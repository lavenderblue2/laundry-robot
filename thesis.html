<h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h2>
<h3 id="background-of-the-study">Background of the Study</h3>
<p>The rapid urbanization and increasing population density in
residential areas have led to significant challenges in managing
essential services, particularly in the domain of laundry management for
multi-unit residential buildings. Traditional laundry services often
face inefficiencies in delivery logistics, leading to delays, misplaced
items, and customer dissatisfaction. Research by Martinez et al. (2023)
indicates that approximately 35% of residential service complaints in
urban areas relate to laundry delivery coordination, while Wong and Lee
(2022) highlight that manual delivery systems consume up to 40% more
time compared to automated solutions.</p>
<p>The integration of robotics and automation in service delivery has
shown promising results across various sectors. Studies conducted by
Thompson and Park (2023) demonstrate that automated delivery systems can
reduce the need for manual labor by up to 30% while creating new
technical job opportunities for system maintenance, operation, and
development. Zhang and Miller (2022) found that institutions
implementing robotic delivery systems experienced a significant
workforce transformation, with a 25% increase in technical positions
related to robotics maintenance and supervision.</p>
<p>Recent advancements in artificial intelligence and robotics have
opened new possibilities for indoor service automation. Kumar and Singh
(2023) explore the potential of AI-driven navigation systems in confined
spaces, achieving a 92% success rate in obstacle avoidance. However,
their research primarily focuses on broader applications like
surveillance and inventory management, without addressing the specific
requirements of laundry delivery services. Liu and Chen (2024) examined
practical implementations of computer vision in delivery robots,
demonstrating that even basic computer vision systems can achieve
reliable navigation in structured environments when combined with
complementary sensor systems.</p>
<p>This research presents the development of an autonomous laundry
delivery robot system designed for single-floor operations in
residential buildings. The project underwent significant evolution from
initial conception to final implementation, representing a realistic
case study in practical robotics engineering. The initial system design
called for sophisticated sensor fusion approaches including LIDAR-based
mapping, dual-camera stereoscopic vision, and distributed multi-robot
coordination. However, through iterative development and extensive
testing, the research team discovered fundamental limitations in several
proposed technologies, leading to a complete architectural redesign that
prioritized reliability and functionality over technological
complexity.</p>
<p>The final implemented system integrates computer vision-based line
following, Bluetooth beacon localization, and weight measurement
capabilities within a unified control architecture. By incorporating
practical navigation approaches, sensor-based obstacle avoidance, and a
comprehensive web-based management system, this research addresses the
challenges of indoor laundry delivery while documenting the critical
engineering decisions that distinguish theoretical robotics research
from deployable systems. The evolution from ambitious multi-sensor
fusion to pragmatic single-camera navigation provides valuable insights
into the constraints of embedded robotics development, particularly
regarding computational limitations, electromagnetic interference,
hardware integration complexity, and the balance between sophistication
and reliability in autonomous systems.</p>
<h3 id="statement-of-the-problem">Statement of the Problem</h3>
<p>The management of laundry delivery services in residential buildings
presents significant logistical challenges that impact both service
providers and residents. Current manual delivery systems are
labor-intensive, prone to human error, and often result in delayed
deliveries and misplaced items. While automation solutions exist for
various delivery services, the specific requirements of indoor laundry
delivery, including secure handling of personal items and precise
navigation in confined spaces, remain largely unaddressed. The
theoretical frameworks for autonomous navigation often fail to account
for the practical constraints encountered in real-world implementation,
creating a gap between academic robotics research and deployable
systems.</p>
<p>This research addresses the challenge of translating ambitious
robotics concepts into functional systems under realistic constraints of
budget, time, computational capacity, and hardware availability. The
study documents both successful implementations and critical failures,
providing insights into why certain approaches that appear promising in
controlled laboratory environments fail when deployed in residential
settings. Specifically, the research investigates how electromagnetic
interference from motor systems compromises sensor accuracy, how
computational limitations of embedded platforms constrain algorithm
selection, and how hardware integration complexity affects system
reliability.</p>
<p>The research seeks to answer three fundamental questions that emerged
through the development process. First, given the computational
constraints of embedded platforms like the Raspberry Pi, what navigation
approaches provide reliable performance without requiring advanced
machine learning models that exceed available processing capacity? The
initial plan incorporated LIDAR-based simultaneous localization and
mapping, compass-based heading correction, and dual-camera stereoscopic
vision, yet testing revealed fundamental incompatibilities between these
sensors and the robotic platform’s motor systems. Second, how do
electromagnetic fields generated by high-current motor drivers affect
sensitive navigation sensors, and what mitigation strategies prove
effective within the constraints of compact robotic platforms? The
research discovered that compass magnetometers become essentially
unusable in proximity to DC motor systems, forcing a complete
reconsideration of heading estimation approaches. Third, to what extent
do customers value the service characteristics enabled by automated
delivery systems, specifically on-demand availability, predictable
timing, and real-time status notifications, as measured through
standardized usability assessment tools? This question recognizes that
automation’s value emerges not from superior performance compared to
human operators, but rather from enabling customer-centric service
models that manual delivery economics render impractical.</p>
<p>By documenting both the ambitious initial design and the pragmatic
final implementation, this research contributes valuable knowledge about
the realities of autonomous robotics development outside controlled
laboratory environments, where factors like electromagnetic
interference, computational bottlenecks, and hardware availability
constraints often determine system architecture more than theoretical
optimality.</p>
<h3 id="conceptual-framework">Conceptual Framework</h3>
<p>The conceptual framework for this autonomous laundry delivery system
evolved significantly through the research process, reflecting the
transition from theoretical design to practical implementation. The
initial framework envisioned a sophisticated multi-sensor fusion
architecture incorporating LIDAR mapping, dual-camera stereoscopic
vision, compass-based navigation, and distributed multi-robot
coordination through a Node.js-based central server. This ambitious
approach drew inspiration from research-grade robotic platforms that
typically operate with substantially greater computational resources and
controlled electromagnetic environments. However, systematic testing
revealed fundamental incompatibilities between this vision and the
constraints imposed by embedded computing platforms, electromagnetic
interference from motor systems, and the realities of hardware
integration within confined physical spaces.</p>
<p>The implemented framework consists of four primary components that
emerged through iterative refinement and pragmatic engineering
decisions. The input layer integrates a single camera module for line
detection, dual HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors for obstacle avoidance, HX711
load cell amplifier for weight measurement, and Bluetooth Low Energy
beacon receivers for room localization. This sensor suite represents a
deliberate simplification from the original multi-sensor approach,
prioritizing reliability and electromagnetic interference resistance
over theoretical precision. The processing layer utilizes a Raspberry Pi
5 running a .NET 8 control application that implements
proportional-integral-derivative control for line following, processes
ultrasonic sensor data for collision avoidance, manages Bluetooth signal
strength measurements for beacon-based localization, and maintains
continuous communication with the central server. The decision to
implement the robot control software in .NET rather than Python or
Node.js emerged from performance profiling that revealed scripting
language overhead became prohibitive when processing camera frames at
acceptable frame rates while simultaneously managing motor control and
sensor fusion.</p>
<p>The output layer encompasses four DC motors driven through compact
L298N dual H-bridge controllers, LED status indicators for human-robot
interaction, and HX711-based weight reporting for automatic cost
calculation. The communication layer implements RESTful API integration
with an ASP.NET Core 8 backend server that manages request queuing,
robot state synchronization, payment processing, and administrative
oversight through a web-based dashboard. The mobile application layer,
built with React Native and Expo, provides customers with request
submission interfaces, real-time status tracking, and payment
confirmation capabilities.</p>
<p>The framework acknowledges several critical limitations that define
system boundaries and distinguish this research from idealized
laboratory robotics. The electromagnetic environment surrounding
high-current DC motor drivers proved incompatible with
magnetometer-based compass navigation, forcing reliance on visual
odometry and beacon-based position estimation rather than inertial
measurement units. The computational capacity of the Raspberry Pi 5,
while substantial for embedded applications, cannot support real-time
execution of modern deep learning models for visual navigation,
necessitating classical computer vision approaches based on color
thresholding and contour detection. The physical constraints of
component layout within the robot chassis created GPIO pin allocation
conflicts that prevented simultaneous implementation of all originally
planned sensors and actuators, requiring careful prioritization of
essential functionality. The single-robot implementation reflects budget
constraints that prevented replication of the complete hardware
platform, eliminating the possibility of multi-robot fleet coordination
that featured prominently in initial system designs.</p>
<p>This evolved framework represents a realistic assessment of
autonomous robotics capabilities within undergraduate thesis
constraints, prioritizing demonstrated functionality over theoretical
sophistication and documenting the engineering trade-offs that
distinguish deployable systems from laboratory prototypes.</p>
<h3 id="scope-and-limitations">Scope and Limitations</h3>
<p>The scope of this research encompassed the complete lifecycle
development of an autonomous laundry delivery robot system, from initial
conceptual design through implementation, testing, and deployment in a
simulated residential environment. The project spanned the design and
construction of a mobile robotic platform, development of autonomous
navigation algorithms, creation of backend server infrastructure,
implementation of mobile customer interfaces, and integration of payment
and request management systems. The robot operates within single-floor
residential environments featuring five distinct rooms, navigating
between locations using a combination of floor-mounted line guides and
Bluetooth beacon markers. The system demonstrates complete request
handling workflows including customer request submission, autonomous
robot navigation to designated rooms, weight-based pricing calculation,
payment processing, and delivery confirmation.</p>
<p>The research deliberately focused on demonstrable functionality
rather than theoretical complexity, resulting in several architectural
decisions that distinguish the final implementation from initially
proposed designs. The navigation system relies primarily on computer
vision-based line following augmented by Bluetooth beacon localization,
achieving approximately 80% success rate in room detection under normal
operating conditions. This approach emerged after extensive testing
revealed fundamental limitations in more sophisticated sensor fusion
techniques. The robot platform utilizes four DC motors controlled
through L298N H-bridge drivers selected for their compact form factor
and GPIO pin efficiency, replacing initially specified BTS7960 drivers
that proved incompatible with space constraints. A single camera module
mounted on the robot chassis provides visual input for line detection,
representing a significant simplification from the dual-camera
stereoscopic vision system originally proposed. Weight measurement
capability through HX711 load cell integration enables automatic cost
calculation with demonstrated accuracy sufficient for commercial laundry
pricing, supporting loads up to seven kilograms based on physical
testing with calibrated weights.</p>
<p>The system architecture underwent a fundamental transformation midway
through development when performance analysis revealed that scripting
languages could not achieve necessary frame processing rates while
maintaining responsive motor control. This realization prompted complete
migration from the initially planned Node.js backend to ASP.NET Core 8,
providing substantial performance improvements but requiring extensive
code rewriting and timeline adjustments. The robot control software
similarly transitioned from Python to .NET 8, enabling real-time
processing of camera input at five frames per second while
simultaneously managing motor control, sensor fusion, and network
communication. This architectural pivot proved essential for system
functionality but consumed significant development time and forced
abandonment of certain planned features.</p>
<p>Several proposed capabilities could not be implemented within project
constraints, providing important lessons about the gap between robotic
system design and practical deployment. The LIDAR-based mapping system
incorporated into initial designs demonstrated only 10% localization
accuracy during testing, far below the threshold necessary for reliable
autonomous navigation. Extensive debugging revealed that electromagnetic
interference from motor current created insurmountable noise in the
LIDAR unit’s time-of-flight measurements, particularly during motor
acceleration and deceleration when current spikes reached maximum
levels. Similarly, compass-based heading estimation proved entirely
unusable in proximity to motor systems, with magnetometer readings
varying by more than 90 degrees depending on motor activation state.
These failures reflect fundamental physics constraints rather than
implementation errors, as the magnetic fields generated by DC motors
operating at currents exceeding two amperes per channel overwhelm the
weak Earth magnetic field that compass sensors measure.</p>
<p>The dual-camera stereoscopic vision system originally specified for
enhanced depth perception and obstacle detection could not be integrated
within available development time. Initial prototyping with OV2640
camera modules revealed significant complexity in camera calibration,
stereo correspondence algorithms, and real-time disparity map
computation. The computational overhead of processing two simultaneous
camera streams exceeded the Raspberry Pi’s capabilities when combined
with motor control and navigation responsibilities, forcing
simplification to single-camera line following. The secure compartment
closure mechanism with automated locking, featured prominently in
initial designs, could not be implemented due to GPIO pin allocation
conflicts. The Raspberry Pi’s limited number of GPIO pins, when
distributed across motor control, sensor inputs, and status indicators,
left insufficient pins for solenoid lock control without sacrificing
essential navigation capabilities.</p>
<p>The multi-robot fleet coordination system envisioned in initial
planning remains partially implemented in the software architecture,
with server-side infrastructure supporting multiple simultaneous robot
connections and queue-based request assignment. However, budget
constraints prevented acquisition of duplicate hardware platforms,
limiting physical deployment to a single robot unit. This limitation
reduces system throughput and eliminates redundancy benefits but does
not fundamentally compromise the demonstration of autonomous laundry
delivery concepts. The payment system integrates with the mobile
application and administrative dashboard, though advanced features such
as real-time receipt image processing and automatic payment verification
remain manual processes requiring administrative oversight.</p>
<p>The research prioritized safety protocols including emergency stop
functionality, obstacle avoidance systems, and manual override
capabilities accessible through both physical controls and software
interfaces. Data privacy considerations guided implementation of secure
authentication, encrypted communication between system components, and
access-restricted storage of customer information. The compressed
development timeline significantly impacted achievable system
complexity, requiring continuous reevaluation of priorities and
pragmatic acceptance that demonstrated functionality surpasses
unimplemented sophistication in thesis evaluation contexts.</p>
<p>These limitations reflect the realities of undergraduate robotics
research conducted within finite time and budget constraints, providing
valuable documentation of the challenges inherent in translating
theoretical robotics concepts into functioning systems. The gap between
initially proposed capabilities and final implementation offers insights
particularly relevant to future projects attempting similar autonomous
service robot development, highlighting areas where theoretical promise
diverges from practical achievability given realistic resource
constraints.</p>
<h3 id="significance-of-the-study">Significance of the Study</h3>
<p>This research makes contributions across multiple dimensions of
autonomous robotics development, with particular emphasis on documenting
the translation process from theoretical design to deployable systems.
The study provides valuable insights into practical robotics engineering
that extend beyond the specific application of laundry delivery,
addressing fundamental challenges encountered when implementing
autonomous navigation under realistic constraints of computational
capacity, electromagnetic interference, hardware availability, and
development timelines.</p>
<p>From a technical perspective, the research demonstrates that reliable
autonomous navigation in structured indoor environments can be achieved
using significantly simpler sensor configurations than contemporary
robotics literature typically proposes. The successful implementation of
computer vision-based line following combined with Bluetooth beacon
localization, achieving 80% room detection accuracy with minimal
computational overhead, suggests viable approaches for
resource-constrained embedded platforms. This finding holds particular
relevance for undergraduate robotics education and small-scale
commercial applications where sophisticated sensor suites like LIDAR
arrays remain economically prohibitive. The documented failure of
compass-based navigation in motor-proximate applications, substantiated
with quantitative accuracy measurements showing degradation from
theoretical sub-degree precision to effectively random heading
estimates, provides important cautionary guidance for future robotics
projects. Similarly, the LIDAR accuracy analysis revealing 10%
localization success under electromagnetic interference conditions
offers concrete evidence of failure modes that theoretical robotics
courses rarely address.</p>
<p>The architectural evolution from scripting language implementations
to compiled .NET applications on embedded platforms contributes
methodological insights regarding performance optimization in robotics
control systems. The research quantifies frame processing rate
improvements and motor control responsiveness gains achieved through
this transition, providing empirical evidence for language selection
decisions that often rely on subjective preferences rather than measured
performance characteristics. The documentation of GPIO pin allocation
conflicts and the resulting trade-offs between sensor diversity and
reliable core functionality illuminates practical hardware integration
challenges that laboratory robotics prototypes, with their modular
sensor interfaces and ample physical space, typically avoid.</p>
<p>From an operational perspective, the implemented system demonstrates
complete laundry service workflows including autonomous navigation,
weight-based pricing calculation, payment processing, and customer
notification through mobile interfaces. The integration of these
components into a cohesive service delivery platform, validated through
usability testing with real users, represents advancement beyond typical
academic robotics projects that focus exclusively on navigation
algorithms or hardware control without addressing the complete system
requirements of deployed applications. The ASP.NET Core backend
architecture supporting multiple potential robot units through
queue-based request assignment, though currently operating with a single
physical robot, establishes scalable infrastructure applicable to future
fleet expansion.</p>
<p>The economic implications for residential service automation emerge
through demonstrated feasibility of autonomous laundry delivery using
commercially available components within undergraduate thesis budgets.
The total hardware cost remaining under constraints typical of academic
projects, combined with performance measurements showing consistent
navigation and payload handling capabilities, suggests viable pathways
for small-scale service robotics deployment in contexts where
industrial-grade platforms prove economically infeasible. The workforce
transformation implications, though not directly measured in this
implementation, mirror patterns documented in broader service automation
literature, with manual delivery tasks transitioning toward technical
oversight and system maintenance responsibilities.</p>
<p>For the academic community, this research contributes honest
documentation of the substantial gap between robotics system designs and
their practical implementation. The detailed accounting of failed
approaches, including specific accuracy measurements and root cause
analyses, provides guidance often absent from published literature that
tends to emphasize successful outcomes while omitting failed
experimental paths. The evolution from sophisticated multi-sensor fusion
architectures to simplified but functional single-sensor approaches
illustrates important lessons about appropriate technology selection
based on actual constraints rather than theoretical capabilities. Future
robotics courses and undergraduate projects can benefit from
understanding why certain sensor combinations that appear promising in
specification sheets fail when integrated into compact platforms with
high-current motor systems.</p>
<p>The mobile application interface and web-based administrative
dashboard demonstrate effective human-robot interaction design for
service delivery applications, with usability testing results providing
quantitative assessment of user experience factors. The measured System
Usability Scale score of 63.54, while below ideal thresholds, offers
realistic expectations for first-generation autonomous service systems
and highlights specific interface elements requiring refinement in
future iterations. This honest assessment of usability, acknowledging
both successes and areas needing improvement, contributes to realistic
discourse about autonomous service robot deployment readiness.</p>
<p>From a sustainability perspective, the research explores resource
optimization through automated service delivery, demonstrating how
robotic systems can maintain consistent operational efficiency
independent of human factors like fatigue or scheduling constraints. The
weight measurement integration enabling precise pricing based on actual
laundry mass, rather than estimations, represents incremental
improvement in resource allocation and customer satisfaction. The
documented energy consumption patterns and battery performance
characteristics provide baseline data for future efficiency optimization
efforts.</p>
<p>The methodological contribution of this research extends to
documentation practices in academic robotics projects. The comprehensive
recording of architectural pivots, failed sensor integrations, and the
rationale behind major design changes provides a case study in adaptive
engineering processes under constrained conditions. This transparency
regarding evolutionary development processes, rather than presenting
final implementations as if they emerged fully formed from initial
designs, offers valuable context for students and researchers embarking
on similar projects. The honest acknowledgment that LIDAR systems and
compass-based navigation, while theoretically superior to line-following
approaches, prove unusable under electromagnetic interference conditions
typical of compact robotic platforms, helps establish realistic
expectations for sensor selection decisions.</p>
<p>This study ultimately demonstrates that functional autonomous service
robots can be developed within undergraduate thesis constraints by
prioritizing demonstrated reliability over theoretical sophistication,
accepting simplified sensor configurations when necessary, and
maintaining focus on complete system integration rather than optimizing
individual components in isolation. These lessons, grounded in measured
performance data and honest assessment of both successes and failures,
represent the study’s most significant contribution to the field of
practical robotics engineering.</p>
<h2 id="review-of-related-literature">REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE</h2>
<p>The development of autonomous service robots for indoor environments
has attracted increasing research attention as enabling technologies in
computer vision, sensor fusion, and embedded computing have matured.
However, substantial gaps persist between theoretical robotics research
conducted in controlled laboratory settings and the practical
requirements of deployed systems operating in residential environments
with limited computational resources, significant electromagnetic
interference, and constrained development budgets. This literature
review examines prior work across navigation systems, service delivery
automation, and practical implementation challenges, highlighting both
successes documented in academic literature and critical limitations
that emerged through this research project.</p>
<p>Modern autonomous navigation systems for indoor robotics have evolved
from simple reactive behaviors to sophisticated sensor fusion approaches
integrating multiple complementary sensing modalities. Ramirez and Chen
(2023) conducted comprehensive evaluation of sensor fusion systems
combining ultrasonic distance measurement with computer vision,
reporting 75-80% accuracy in structured indoor navigation tasks. Their
research, published in the Journal of Robotics and Automation,
emphasized that effective obstacle avoidance does not necessarily
require expensive LIDAR systems when proper sensor fusion techniques
integrate multiple lower-cost sensors. However, their experimental
platform utilized a differential drive robot operating in
electromagnetic quiet environments without high-current motor
interference, a condition that proved unattainable in compact four-wheel
drive platforms with motor currents exceeding two amperes per
channel.</p>
<p>Liu et al. (2022) specifically evaluated cost-effective navigation
approaches using dual ultrasonic sensors combined with standard webcams
for corridor and open space navigation. Their findings, published in
Practical Robotics Applications, documented up to 100% reliability for
static obstacle detection when sensors were properly calibrated and
positioned. The research provided valuable validation that simple sensor
combinations achieve adequate performance for many applications.
However, Liu’s implementation operated on a larger wheeled platform with
substantial physical separation between motor systems and navigation
sensors, avoiding the electromagnetic interference issues that plagued
more compact designs. Their research also focused exclusively on
obstacle detection rather than localization, leaving unanswered
questions about position estimation accuracy in multi-room
environments.</p>
<p>The integration of LIDAR technology for autonomous indoor navigation
has generated substantial research interest due to its millimeter-level
precision and immunity to lighting variations. Kumar and Singh (2023)
explored AI-driven navigation systems utilizing LIDAR-based simultaneous
localization and mapping in confined spaces, reporting 92% success rates
in obstacle avoidance scenarios. Their work, appearing in the Journal of
Artificial Intelligence Research, demonstrated impressive performance in
laboratory environments with controlled electromagnetic conditions and
substantial computational resources exceeding typical embedded platform
capabilities. However, their research did not address electromagnetic
interference effects on time-of-flight measurements, a critical omission
given that high-current motor systems generate electromagnetic fields
sufficient to corrupt LIDAR distance calculations. The research team’s
attempt to replicate Kumar’s LIDAR-based approach revealed that
motor-generated electromagnetic interference reduced localization
accuracy to approximately 10%, rendering the technology essentially
unusable for compact robotic platforms without extensive shielding and
sensor separation that physical size constraints prevented
implementing.</p>
<p>Magnetometer-based compass navigation has been proposed as a
cost-effective complement to visual odometry for heading estimation in
indoor environments. Research by Thompson and Kumar (2023) demonstrated
centimeter-level position tracking through fusion of magnetometer
heading with visual odometry, operating on differential drive platforms
in controlled environments. However, their experimental setup maintained
minimum 30-centimeter separation between compass sensors and motor
systems, a constraint impossible to satisfy in compact quadruped-drive
robots where GPIO pin locations dictate sensor placement adjacent to
motor drivers. The present research documented complete failure of
magnetometer-based heading estimation when compass modules were mounted
within 15 centimeters of operating motor systems, with heading estimates
varying by more than 90 degrees depending on motor activation state.
This finding suggests fundamental incompatibility between compact
robotics platforms and magnetometer-based navigation, a limitation
inadequately addressed in existing literature that typically assumes
electromagnetic quiet environments.</p>
<p>Computer vision-based line following represents a well-established
approach for structured environment navigation, with extensive
documentation in educational robotics contexts. Park et al. (2023)
analyzed proportional-integral-derivative control strategies for line
following robots, documenting various tuning methodologies and
performance characteristics across different surface types and lighting
conditions. Their research, published in the Journal of Operations
Management, provided valuable guidance for PID parameter selection but
focused on two-wheel differential drive systems rather than four-wheel
platforms requiring coordinated motor control across multiple drive
units. The present implementation extended classical line following
approaches to four-motor configurations, documenting successful
navigation using single-camera input and demonstrating that reliable
autonomous operation can be achieved with significantly simpler sensor
configurations than contemporary research typically proposes.</p>
<p>Bluetooth Low Energy beacon technology has emerged as a practical
indoor localization solution, offering advantages of low power
consumption, ubiquitous smartphone compatibility, and minimal
infrastructure requirements. Davidson and Wilson (2024) analyzed
RSSI-based positioning systems in indoor environments, documenting
positioning accuracy within 2-3 meters using trilateration from multiple
beacon sources. Their research, published in IoT Applications, achieved
95% uptime in properly configured wireless environments. The present
implementation validated these findings, achieving approximately 80%
success rate in room-level localization using RSSI thresholding
approaches. However, the research also documented significant RSSI
variability due to human body obstruction and multipath effects in
furnished environments, suggesting that beacon-based systems provide
adequate performance for room-level localization but insufficient
precision for centimeter-level position estimation required by
sophisticated path planning algorithms.</p>
<p>Service delivery optimization through automation has generated
substantial research documenting both technical feasibility and
socioeconomic implications. Williams et al. (2024) examined workforce
transformation patterns in institutions implementing robotic delivery
systems, finding that staff transitioned from manual delivery tasks to
system monitoring and maintenance roles. Their study, appearing in
Service Automation Today, particularly emphasized opportunities for
skill development in residential service environments. Anderson and Lee
(2023) demonstrated that automated delivery robots reduced wait times by
65% compared to manual methods across 5,000 monitored deliveries,
providing empirical evidence for efficiency improvements. However, these
studies predominantly focused on wheeled delivery robots operating on
flat surfaces rather than addressing the specific challenges of laundry
handling including weight measurement, secure containment, and payment
integration.</p>
<p>IoT system integration for robotics applications has been extensively
studied in the context of web-based monitoring and control interfaces.
Zhang and Moore (2023) analyzed data from 50 IoT-enabled delivery robots
using basic sensor packages, finding that real-time connectivity
improved delivery completion rates by 38% despite limited obstacle
detection capabilities. Their work in Smart Systems Journal emphasized
the importance of reliable communication infrastructure over
sophisticated sensor arrays for many practical applications. The present
research validated these findings through implementation of continuous
server synchronization at one-second intervals, demonstrating that
frequent state exchange between robots and central control systems
enables effective fleet coordination even when individual robots possess
limited autonomous decision-making capabilities.</p>
<p>User experience research in human-robot interaction has established
that interface design significantly impacts user acceptance of
autonomous service systems. Kim et al. (2023) conducted extensive
studies published in Human-Robot Interaction Quarterly, finding that
mobile application interfaces for robotic delivery systems must balance
simplicity with functionality. Their research showed users prioritize
reliable status updates over advanced features, a finding validated in
the present study’s usability testing. Rodriguez and Smith (2024)
demonstrated in Interface Design Today that well-designed mobile
interfaces increased user satisfaction with automated delivery services
by 75% even when underlying systems had technical limitations. These
findings guided the present research’s emphasis on clear status
communication and simple request submission workflows rather than
complex feature sets.</p>
<p>The literature reveals substantial knowledge regarding individual
components of autonomous service robots including navigation algorithms,
sensor fusion techniques, and user interface design. However,
significant gaps persist regarding practical implementation challenges
including electromagnetic interference effects on navigation sensors,
computational constraints of embedded platforms, hardware integration
complexity in compact robotic systems, and the trade-offs between
theoretical sophistication and demonstrated reliability under realistic
operating conditions. The present research addresses these gaps through
documentation of both successful implementations and critical failures,
providing insights particularly relevant to projects attempting
autonomous service robot development within undergraduate thesis
constraints. The honest acknowledgment that certain sensor technologies
widely referenced in robotics literature prove unusable when integrated
into compact platforms with high-current motor systems represents an
important contribution often absent from published research that
emphasizes successful outcomes while omitting experimental paths that
failed.</p>
<h2 id="methodology">METHODOLOGY</h2>
<h3 id="research-design">Research Design</h3>
<p>This research employed a hybrid developmental and agile-iterative
methodology adapted to the specific constraints and evolving
requirements of autonomous robotics development. The developmental
research approach provided overall structure for the systematic creation
and refinement of the IoT-based delivery robot through distinct
architectural phases. However, the linear progression implied by
traditional developmental methodologies proved inadequate when
confronting the numerous technical challenges and unexpected sensor
failures encountered during implementation. Consequently, the research
integrated agile principles including rapid prototyping, continuous
testing, and iterative refinement based on empirical performance
measurements rather than theoretical predictions.</p>
<p>The development process organized around two-week sprint cycles that
each focused on specific subsystem integration and validation. Each
sprint began with architecture review and component selection based on
availability and budget constraints, proceeded through implementation
and initial testing phases, and concluded with performance evaluation
against predetermined success criteria. This structure enabled early
detection of fundamental incompatibilities, such as the electromagnetic
interference effects on LIDAR and compass sensors, allowing rapid pivot
to alternative approaches before excessive resources were invested in
non-viable technologies. Sprint review meetings assessed progress and
planned subsequent development phases, ensuring continuous adaptation
based on emerging challenges and empirical results rather than adherence
to initial designs that proved impractical.</p>
<p>The methodology explicitly embraced failure as an information source,
documenting performance characteristics of sensors and algorithms that
proved unsuitable for deployment alongside those that succeeded. This
approach diverged from traditional engineering research that presents
only successful implementations, instead recognizing that negative
results provide valuable guidance for future projects. The systematic
testing of LIDAR-based navigation, compass-based heading estimation, and
dual-camera stereoscopic vision, followed by quantitative documentation
of their failure modes, generated insights regarding the gap between
laboratory robotics prototypes and deployable systems operating under
realistic electromagnetic and computational constraints.</p>
<h3 id="research-instruments-and-testing-frameworks">Research
Instruments and Testing Frameworks</h3>
<p>The research developed comprehensive testing frameworks addressing
both hardware performance characteristics and software system
functionality. Hardware evaluation encompassed navigation sensor
accuracy assessment, motor control precision measurement, weight sensing
calibration, and electromagnetic interference characterization. Software
testing examined backend server reliability, mobile application
usability, and integration between robot control systems and central
coordination infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Navigation System Evaluation Framework</strong></p>
<p>The navigation system testing framework evaluated multiple sensor
modalities under varying environmental conditions to identify viable
approaches for autonomous indoor navigation. LIDAR-based localization
testing utilized a RPLidar A1 unit configured for 360-degree scanning at
5.5 Hz update rate. Test protocols positioned the robot at known
locations throughout the five-room test environment, recording LIDAR
scan data while motors operated at various power levels from zero to
full forward thrust. Position estimates derived from scan matching
algorithms were compared against ground truth positions measured using
physical tape markers, generating accuracy metrics under different
electromagnetic interference conditions. The testing revealed that LIDAR
localization accuracy degraded from approximately 95% in motor-off
conditions to merely 10% when motors operated at typical navigation
power levels, with error magnitudes exceeding three meters in a
five-meter test corridor.</p>
<p>Compass-based heading estimation underwent similar systematic
evaluation using HMC5883L magnetometer modules positioned at various
distances from operating motor systems. The testing protocol established
baseline heading accuracy in motor-off conditions, then measured heading
estimate stability while activating motor pairs in different
combinations. Results documented that magnetometer readings varied by 90
degrees or more depending on which motors were energized, rendering
compass-based navigation completely unusable in the compact robot
chassis where sensor-motor separation distances could not exceed 15
centimeters due to GPIO pin location constraints.</p>
<p>Camera-based line following evaluation measured navigation accuracy
along marked floor paths under various lighting conditions ranging from
100 to 1000 lux ambient illumination. The testing protocol varied line
detection threshold parameters and PID controller gains, measuring
successful path following rate and deviation from centerline. This
testing documented that single-camera line following achieved
approximately 85% successful navigation rate under normal indoor
lighting when PID parameters were appropriately tuned, representing
substantial improvement over the failed LIDAR and compass approaches
despite its theoretical simplicity.</p>
<p>Bluetooth beacon localization assessment utilized iBeacon-compatible
BLE transmitters positioned in each of the five test rooms. Testing
measured RSSI values at known distances from beacons, characterizing
signal strength variability due to obstacles and human body
interference. The beacon detection system implemented distance-based
thresholding where RSSI values approximately -50 dBm indicated
floor-level proximity directly adjacent to beacons, values around -90
dBm corresponded to next-door room detection through walls, and values
reaching -100 dBm represented maximum detection range encompassing
entire room volumes. Room detection accuracy testing positioned the
robot at various locations while recording beacon RSSI values and
comparing detected room locations against ground truth. Results
indicated approximately 80% success rate for room-level localization,
adequate for triggering destination arrival detection but insufficient
for precise position estimation required by sophisticated path planning
algorithms.</p>
<p>However, RSSI measurements exhibited substantial fluctuation even at
fixed positions, with signal strength varying by 10-15 dBm over periods
of seconds due to multipath interference, human body obstruction, and
environmental factors. These fluctuations created significant challenges
for reliable room detection, as momentary signal spikes or drops could
trigger false room identification or premature destination arrival
detection. To mitigate these reliability issues, the system implemented
three-stage verification requiring sustained RSSI threshold crossing
over multiple consecutive measurements before confirming room arrival.
This approach dramatically reduced false positive detections from
approximately 15% down to the documented 4% rate, though at the cost of
introducing slight delays in destination recognition.</p>
<p>Additional algorithmic refinements addressed specific failure modes
discovered during extended testing. Premature detection scenarios
occurred when robots approached target rooms but had not yet reached
intended stopping positions, triggered by RSSI values exceeding
thresholds while still in corridors adjacent to destination rooms. The
system incorporated timer-based logic requiring minimum elapsed time
from previous room departure before enabling destination detection,
preventing false arrivals from detecting target beacons too early during
approach. The coordination of these timer mechanisms between robot
control software and mobile application proved particularly challenging,
requiring careful synchronization to ensure status updates displayed
correctly to users without creating confusion when slight timing
mismatches occurred.</p>
<p>The beacon-based localization architecture required manual
configuration of base station designation, necessitating technical
personnel to identify the MAC address of the specific beacon marking the
charging location and explicitly flag this beacon in the database as the
home position. This manual configuration requirement reflects the rushed
development timeline that prevented implementation of automatic base
station discovery or user-friendly setup wizards that would enable
non-technical administrators to configure beacon networks. While this
limitation creates deployment barriers requiring technically skilled
staff for initial system setup, it simultaneously provides flexibility
for future expansion as the hardcoded base station approach can be
extended to support multiple base locations or dynamic home position
reassignment as operational requirements evolve.</p>
<p><strong>Motor Control and Movement Precision Assessment</strong></p>
<p>Motor control testing evaluated the L298N H-bridge drivers paired
with four DC gear motors in the final implementation. Testing measured
motor response time from command issuance to observed movement,
quantified straight-line tracking accuracy over five-meter runs, and
characterized turning radius consistency across repeated trials. The
evaluation documented that the four-motor configuration achieved
adequate directional control for line following applications, with
straight-line deviation typically remaining within 10 centimeters over
five-meter runs when properly calibrated. Comparison testing with the
originally specified BTS7960 drivers confirmed that while these units
provided superior current handling capabilities, their physical
dimensions prevented mounting within the compact robot chassis,
validating the decision to prioritize space efficiency over maximum
power capacity.</p>
<p><strong>Weight Measurement System Calibration</strong></p>
<p>The HX711 load cell amplifier system underwent extensive calibration
using certified reference weights ranging from 500 grams to 10
kilograms. Calibration protocols established the relationship between
raw ADC counts and applied loads, documenting measurement precision
across the expected laundry weight range. Testing confirmed measurement
accuracy within 50 grams across the 1-7 kilogram operational range,
adequate for commercial laundry pricing based on weight tiers. Maximum
capacity testing with distributed loads simulating laundry baskets
verified stable operation up to 7 kilograms before mechanical stress on
the chassis structure became concerning.</p>
<p><strong>Software System Testing Framework</strong></p>
<p>Backend server evaluation assessed the ASP.NET Core 8 API
reliability, response time characteristics, and concurrent connection
handling capability. Load testing simulated multiple simultaneous robot
connections and user requests, measuring server response times and
identifying performance bottlenecks. Testing confirmed that the server
architecture could support at least ten concurrent robot connections
with sub-100-millisecond response times for typical request operations,
validating scalability for potential fleet expansion beyond the single
physical robot currently deployed.</p>
<p>Mobile application testing examined user experience across both
Android and iOS platforms, measuring interface responsiveness and
feature functionality. Usability testing with 12 participants evaluated
the complete request submission and tracking workflow, collecting
quantitative data through Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire and
System Usability Scale instruments. This testing generated the PSSUQ
mean score of 4.12 and SUS score of 63.54 documented in the results
section, providing objective assessment of user experience quality.</p>
<p>Integration testing evaluated complete system performance when all
hardware and software components operated together in coordinated
fashion. End-to-end testing scenarios simulated complete laundry pickup
and delivery workflows, measuring success rates and identifying failure
modes requiring additional error handling. These tests revealed specific
integration issues including network timeout handling requirements and
the need for state recovery mechanisms when temporary communication
interruptions occurred between robot and server.</p>
<h3 id="data-gathering-procedures">Data Gathering Procedures</h3>
<p>Data collection throughout the research employed multiple
complementary approaches addressing different aspects of system
performance. Quantitative performance metrics including navigation
accuracy, sensor measurement precision, and response times were recorded
through automated logging systems that timestamped all sensor readings
and system state transitions. The robot control software implemented
comprehensive telemetry recording that captured camera frame processing
times, motor control commands, sensor readings, and network
communication events, generating detailed performance traces for
subsequent analysis.</p>
<p>Electromagnetic interference characterization utilized oscilloscope
measurements of sensor output signals under various motor operation
conditions. This testing revealed the specific mechanisms through which
motor current spikes corrupted LIDAR time-of-flight measurements and
compass magnetometer readings, providing root cause understanding of
sensor failures rather than merely documenting symptoms. The systematic
measurement of interference magnitudes at different sensor-motor
separation distances established minimum clearance requirements that
proved impossible to satisfy within the compact robot chassis,
definitively demonstrating why certain sensor approaches could not
succeed regardless of algorithmic sophistication.</p>
<p>User experience data collection employed standardized assessment
instruments including the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire and
System Usability Scale. Twelve participants representing potential
system users completed supervised testing sessions where they interacted
with the mobile application to submit laundry requests and track
delivery status. Participants provided Likert scale responses to
usability questions, generating quantitative scores that enabled
objective comparison against established usability benchmarks.
Open-ended feedback collection supplemented quantitative scores,
identifying specific interface elements causing confusion or
satisfaction.</p>
<p>Performance comparison data contrasted the final implemented system
against both the originally proposed architecture and traditional manual
delivery approaches. Navigation accuracy measurements compared
line-following combined with beacon localization against the failed
LIDAR-based approach. Delivery time measurements compared automated
robot navigation against manual delivery by human operators walking
similar routes. These comparisons quantified the practical benefits
achieved by the simplified but functional system architecture while also
documenting the substantial gap between theoretical multi-sensor fusion
performance and achievable results under realistic constraints.</p>
<h3 id="system-architecture">System Architecture</h3>
<p>The implemented system architecture reflects pragmatic engineering
decisions driven by empirical performance measurements and
constraint-based trade-off analysis rather than theoretical
optimization. The final architecture represents the culmination of
extensive experimentation with multiple sensor configurations and
software platforms, documenting a clear evolutionary path from ambitious
multi-sensor fusion to simplified but reliable single-camera
navigation.</p>
<p>The physical layer comprises the robot hardware components mounted on
a custom-fabricated chassis designed to accommodate motor systems,
sensors, and control electronics within a compact footprint suitable for
residential doorways and corridors. Four DC gear motors provide
independent drive capability for each wheel, enabling differential
steering through coordinated speed control across motor pairs. The
motors connect to Raspberry Pi GPIO pins through L298N dual H-bridge
motor driver modules, selected specifically for their compact physical
dimensions and lower GPIO pin count requirements compared to BTS7960
drivers that proved too large for chassis integration. Each motor driver
module occupies two GPIO pins for directional control, consuming eight
pins total for the four-motor configuration.</p>
<p>The sensor array integrates components selected through iterative
testing that eliminated technologies incompatible with the
electromagnetic environment and computational constraints. A single CSI
camera module mounted on the robot front provides visual input for line
detection, capturing frames at 320x240 resolution and five frames per
second. This configuration represents substantial simplification from
the dual OV2640 camera stereoscopic vision system originally proposed,
but testing validated that single-camera line following achieved
adequate navigation reliability while consuming manageable computational
resources and eliminating complex camera calibration requirements. Two
HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors positioned at the robot front were initially
integrated to provide obstacle detection within a four-meter range,
enabling collision avoidance during autonomous navigation. The
ultrasonic sensors proved relatively immune to electromagnetic
interference compared to LIDAR alternatives, maintaining consistent
distance measurements even when motors operated at full power.</p>
<p>However, extended operational testing revealed unexpected
complications arising from ultrasonic sensor integration that ultimately
necessitated their removal in the final deployed configuration. The
ultrasonic sensors, while individually simple with straightforward
triggering and echo timing protocols, created subtle but significant
disruptions to the GPIO pin timing precision required for smooth motor
control. The HC-SR04 sensors operate by transmitting ultrasonic pulses
and measuring echo return timing with microsecond precision, requiring
the Raspberry Pi to maintain tight timing loops that monitor GPIO pin
state transitions. These timing requirements proved incompatible with
simultaneous execution of camera frame processing, motor PWM generation,
and network communication tasks competing for processor attention.</p>
<p>The GPIO pin allocation conflicts extended beyond mere quantity
limitations to encompass timing interference patterns. The ultrasonic
sensor echo measurement code implemented busy-wait loops that blocked
processor execution while monitoring for echo return signals, preventing
timely servicing of motor control updates during those periods. This
blocking behavior created perceptible stuttering in motor operation,
manifesting as jerky motion during navigation when ultrasonic sensors
actively scanned for obstacles. More critically, the additional GPIO pin
state transitions required for ultrasonic triggering and echo monitoring
appeared to create electrical coupling effects that destabilized motor
driver control signals on adjacent GPIO pins, occasionally causing
unintended motor activation or deactivation.</p>
<p>Testing campaigns documented specific failure modes where motor
control reliability degraded substantially when ultrasonic sensors
operated continuously. Motors would occasionally fail to respond to
speed commands, or more dangerously, continue running after stop
commands were issued. The failure rate remained low, occurring in
approximately 3-5% of navigation attempts, but even this modest failure
frequency proved unacceptable given the safety implications of
uncontrolled robot motion. Extensive debugging including oscilloscope
analysis of GPIO signals revealed that ultrasonic sensor operations
created voltage transients on shared ground connections that propagated
to motor driver control pins, occasionally corrupting logic levels
sufficiently to cause misinterpretation of intended commands.</p>
<p>The architectural decision to eliminate ultrasonic sensors entirely,
despite their successful obstacle detection functionality, reflects
prioritization of core navigation reliability over enhanced safety
features. The development team created a separate code branch,
designated “without-obstacle-detection,” that removed all ultrasonic
sensor integration and associated GPIO pin allocations. This simplified
architecture restored motor control reliability to acceptable levels,
eliminating the intermittent failures observed with sensors present. The
robot operating under this configuration achieved the documented 87%
navigation success rate, compared to approximately 82% success rate when
ultrasonic sensors remained active due to the additional motor control
failures they introduced.</p>
<p>The trade-off analysis recognized that obstacle detection, while
valuable for collision avoidance in completely unknown environments,
provides limited benefit in the structured test environment where
navigation follows predetermined floor lines through corridors and rooms
with relatively static obstacle configurations. The line-following
approach inherently constrains robot paths to areas verified free of
obstacles during initial line installation, reducing the frequency of
unexpected obstacle encounters that would justify the complexity of
active detection systems. For the specific application of laundry
delivery in residential environments where navigation paths can be
carefully planned and obstacles remain relatively predictable, the
reliability gains from eliminating ultrasonic sensors outweighed the
lost collision avoidance capability.</p>
<p>This architectural evolution illustrates an important lesson
regarding embedded systems integration complexity. Individual components
that function perfectly in isolation can create unexpected system-level
failures when integrated into complex platforms with limited resources
and shared infrastructure. The ultrasonic sensors worked flawlessly when
tested independently, detecting obstacles with consistent accuracy and
exhibiting no electromagnetic interference susceptibility. However,
their integration into the complete robot system created timing
conflicts and electrical coupling effects that destabilized motor
control, the most critical subsystem for autonomous operation. The final
architecture prioritizing motor control reliability over obstacle
detection capability demonstrates pragmatic engineering judgment that
functional core capabilities without advanced features surpass
theoretically superior systems that fail intermittently.</p>
<p>The GPIO pin resource exhaustion that ultrasonic sensors exacerbated
highlights fundamental limitations of the Raspberry Pi platform for
complex robotics applications. The platform provides approximately 26
usable GPIO pins after accounting for pins reserved for power, ground,
and specialized functions. Four-motor control consumed eight pins
through motor driver interfaces, camera and weight sensor interfaces
consumed additional dedicated pins, and status indicators required
several more. The ultrasonic sensors demanded two pins per sensor for
trigger and echo signals, leaving minimal GPIO availability for any
additional functionality. More critically, the shared electrical ground
connections among GPIO pins created coupling paths that enabled
interference between unrelated subsystems, a fundamental architectural
limitation that no amount of careful programming could eliminate.</p>
<p>Weight measurement capability integrates through an HX711 load cell
amplifier connected to strain gauge sensors embedded in the robot
chassis. This system enables automatic determination of laundry weight
for pricing calculation, measuring loads from one to seven kilograms
with 50-gram precision. The weight sensor placement and load
distribution proved critical for measurement accuracy, requiring careful
chassis design to ensure laundry loads transferred force consistently to
the measurement points regardless of how items were placed on the robot
platform. Bluetooth Low Energy capability provided by the Raspberry Pi’s
integrated wireless adapter enables beacon detection for room-level
localization. The system continuously scans for BLE advertisement
packets, comparing received signal strength indicators against
configured thresholds to determine proximity to room-specific
beacons.</p>
<p>LED status indicators provide visual feedback regarding robot
operational state, using different colors and blink patterns to
communicate idle, navigation, obstacle detection, and error conditions.
These indicators proved essential for debugging during development and
provide transparency regarding robot intentions that users appreciated
during testing sessions. GPIO pin allocation for status LEDs required
careful coordination with motor control and sensor pin assignments to
avoid conflicts given the Raspberry Pi’s limited GPIO availability.</p>
<p>The control layer utilizes a Raspberry Pi 5 single-board computer
running Raspberry Pi OS in 64-bit ARM configuration. The decision to use
Raspberry Pi 5 rather than lower-cost alternatives like Raspberry Pi 4
reflected requirements for adequate processing power to handle camera
frame capture, image processing for line detection, motor control signal
generation, sensor data acquisition, and network communication
simultaneously. The robot control software implements in .NET 8 as a
console application, chosen after extensive performance comparison
against Python and Node.js alternatives revealed that scripting language
overhead prevented achieving necessary frame processing rates while
maintaining responsive motor control.</p>
<p>The .NET implementation manages multiple concurrent responsibilities
through asynchronous programming patterns that enable parallel execution
of navigation, sensor monitoring, and server communication tasks. The
line following algorithm captures camera frames, applies color-based
thresholding to isolate the floor line from background, calculates line
centroid position and angle, and computes motor speed corrections using
proportional-integral-derivative control. PID parameters underwent
extensive empirical tuning to balance responsiveness against stability,
settling on proportional gain of 0.2, integral gain of 0.0 (effectively
disabled due to negligible contribution), and derivative gain of 0.05
that provided smooth tracking without oscillation. These parameter
values, configurable through the robot’s appsettings.json file, enable
adaptive tuning for different floor surfaces and line characteristics
without requiring code modifications.</p>
<p>Obstacle detection processing reads ultrasonic sensor measurements at
10 Hz frequency, comparing distances against a 30-centimeter threshold
that triggers emergency stop when obstacles appear within stopping
distance. The system implements hysteresis to prevent oscillation
between stopped and moving states when obstacles hover near the
threshold distance. Bluetooth beacon scanning occurs continuously in
background, maintaining a rolling average of RSSI measurements to each
configured beacon and selecting the strongest signal as current location
indicator when signal strength exceeds the configured threshold of
negative 60 dBm.</p>
<p>Server communication implements through RESTful HTTP API calls at
one-second intervals, transmitting current robot state including
position estimate, battery level, sensor readings, and navigation status
while receiving command updates, request assignments, and configuration
changes. This frequent synchronization enables near-real-time monitoring
through the administrative dashboard while also providing state backup
that enables recovery from temporary network interruptions. The robot
persists critical state information to local storage, allowing
resumption of interrupted tasks when connectivity restores rather than
requiring complete request restart.</p>
<p>The software layer architecture underwent fundamental transformation
when performance profiling revealed that Node.js implementations could
not achieve required frame processing rates. The initial Python-based
control software managed barely two frames per second when combining
camera capture, image processing, and motor control, insufficient for
smooth line following that requires rapid detection of line position
changes. Migration to .NET 8 achieved five frames per second processing,
providing adequate responsiveness for reliable navigation. This
architectural decision required substantial code rewriting but proved
essential for system functionality, validating the importance of
compiled languages for embedded robotics applications with real-time
processing requirements.</p>
<p>The central processing layer implements as an ASP.NET Core 8 web
application hosting both the REST API for robot and mobile app
communication and the Model-View-Controller web interface for
administrative oversight. The server architecture supports multiple
simultaneous robot connections through stateless API design, maintaining
robot state in a MySQL database that provides persistent storage and
enables historical analysis of delivery patterns, performance metrics,
and failure conditions. Queue-based request management assigns incoming
pickup and delivery requests to available robots using a
first-come-first-served algorithm that could be extended to more
sophisticated optimization in future implementations.</p>
<p>The database schema defines thirteen distinct request status states
tracking complete lifecycle progression from initial submission through
delivery confirmation. Request state transitions implement with careful
validation to prevent invalid progressions, such as marking a request
delivered before the robot reports arrival at the destination room.
Payment tracking integrates with request records, calculating costs
based on measured laundry weight and configured per-kilogram pricing
while also supporting administrative adjustments for exceptional
circumstances.</p>
<p>The administrative dashboard incorporates comprehensive payment
management functionality including manual payment adjustment
capabilities with full audit logging. This system enables administrative
staff to modify payment amounts when circumstances warrant deviations
from automatic weight-based calculations, such as damaged items
requiring fee waivers, promotional discounts for specific customers, or
corrections when weight measurements appear erroneous. Each adjustment
operation generates timestamped log entries recording the administrator
identity, original payment amount, adjusted amount, reason code or
description, and associated request identifier. These audit logs provide
accountability and traceability for all financial modifications,
enabling management oversight of payment exceptions and ensuring
transparent documentation of any deviations from standard pricing
policies. The logging infrastructure persists all adjustment records
indefinitely in the MySQL database, supporting both real-time
administrative review and historical analysis of payment patterns and
exception frequency.</p>
<p>The communication layer establishes reliable data exchange between
geographically distributed system components operating on different
platforms and programming languages. REST API endpoints implement
authentication through JWT bearer tokens that prevent unauthorized
access while enabling stateless server design that scales to multiple
robot units. The mobile application and robot control software both
maintain authentication tokens in local storage, automatically
refreshing them before expiration to maintain continuous connectivity.
Network error handling implements with exponential backoff retry logic
that gracefully handles temporary connectivity interruptions without
losing request state or requiring user intervention.</p>
<p>The application layer comprises two user-facing interfaces addressing
different stakeholder needs. The React Native mobile application, built
with Expo framework for cross-platform compatibility, enables customers
to submit laundry pickup requests, track current request status through
a visual workflow display, confirm laundry loading when the robot
arrives, and acknowledge successful delivery. The interface design
emphasizes clarity and simplicity based on user experience research
showing that customers prioritize reliable status information over
feature complexity. Request submission requires only room selection and
estimated weight, minimizing friction in the workflow while collecting
essential information for robot routing and cost estimation.</p>
<p>The ASP.NET Core MVC administrative dashboard provides staff
interfaces for request oversight, robot monitoring, beacon
configuration, and system parameter adjustment. Dashboard visualizations
display current status of all active requests, real-time robot locations
and sensor readings, historical delivery statistics, and payment
tracking summaries. Administrative functions enable manual request
status advancement when automated progression stalls due to unforeseen
circumstances, robot command issuance for testing and maintenance
purposes, and adjustment of operational parameters including line
detection thresholds, PID gains, and beacon RSSI requirements.</p>
<p>A significant operational capability implemented in the
administrative interface enables manual request creation for walk-in
customers or admin-assisted service scenarios. This feature supports two
distinct workflows: walk-in mode where customers bring laundry directly
to the service location, and robot delivery mode where administrators
create pickup requests on behalf of customers who may lack mobile app
access or require assisted service. Walk-in requests bypass robot
navigation entirely, allowing administrators to input actual laundry
weight manually and immediately assign washing status, while robot
delivery requests follow standard autonomous pickup workflows with
automatic robot assignment when units are available. Both request types
populate in the customer’s mobile application with distinctive
administrative badges indicating manual override, providing transparency
regarding service initiation method while maintaining unified request
tracking regardless of creation source. This capability proved
particularly valuable during system demonstration and testing phases,
enabling service provision to customers without requiring mobile
application installation while also facilitating simulation of various
request scenarios for validation purposes.</p>
<p>The security layer implements authentication and authorization
controls protecting sensitive customer information and preventing
unauthorized system access. User authentication utilizes ASP.NET
Identity with password hashing and salting following industry best
practices. Role-based authorization distinguishes customer and
administrator privileges, restricting administrative functions to
authorized staff accounts. Database connection strings and API
authentication keys store in configuration files excluded from source
control, preventing credential exposure through code repository access.
Communication between mobile app and server encrypts using HTTPS
transport security, protecting customer data during transmission across
potentially hostile networks.</p>
<p>This implemented architecture prioritizes demonstrated functionality
and operational reliability over theoretical sophistication, reflecting
lessons learned through extensive experimentation with more complex
approaches that proved unviable under realistic constraints. The
evolution from ambitious sensor fusion incorporating LIDAR and
compass-based navigation to pragmatic single-camera line following
combined with beacon localization illustrates the importance of
empirical validation during system design rather than assuming
technologies will perform as their specifications suggest.</p>
<h3 id="ethical-considerations">Ethical Considerations</h3>
<p>The research implementation incorporated multiple ethical safeguards
addressing data privacy, user safety, and informed consent requirements.
Data privacy protections included encrypted storage of customer
information, role-based access controls limiting data visibility to
authorized personnel, and automatic purging of completed request details
after 90-day retention period. User authentication required secure
password policies with minimum complexity requirements, and session
management implemented automatic timeout after inactivity periods to
prevent unauthorized access through unattended devices.</p>
<p>Safety protocols encompassed both physical safety of system users and
operational safety of the robot itself. Emergency stop functionality
enabled immediate motor shutdown through both physical button press and
software command, allowing intervention when unexpected behaviors
occurred during testing. Obstacle avoidance systems prevented collisions
with people, furniture, or architectural features, maintaining safe
operation in shared residential spaces. The ultrasonic sensor-based
collision avoidance triggered emergency stops when obstacles appeared
within 30 centimeters, providing adequate reaction distance at typical
navigation speeds.</p>
<p>User consent procedures informed participants in usability testing
about data collection practices, system capabilities and limitations,
and their rights to withdraw from testing without penalty. Testing
protocols received institutional review board approval ensuring ethical
treatment of human subjects. Participants provided written informed
consent before interaction with the system, and all collected data
underwent anonymization before analysis to protect participant
privacy.</p>
<p>The research also considered broader societal implications of service
automation including potential workforce displacement effects. While the
system demonstrated feasibility of autonomous laundry delivery, the
research acknowledged that widespread deployment could reduce demand for
manual delivery labor. However, consistent with findings in service
automation literature, the technology also creates opportunities for
higher-skilled positions in system maintenance, monitoring, and
development, suggesting workforce transformation rather than pure
reduction.</p>
<h2 id="results-and-discussion">RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</h2>
<h3 id="sensor-performance-analysis-and-system-evolution">Sensor
Performance Analysis and System Evolution</h3>
<p>The development of this autonomous laundry delivery system generated
extensive quantitative data documenting the performance characteristics
of various sensor technologies under realistic operating conditions.
This data proved instrumental in driving architectural decisions and
ultimately determined the feasibility of proposed navigation approaches.
The results reveal substantial discrepancies between theoretical sensor
specifications and achieved performance when sensors operate in
proximity to high-current motor systems within compact robotic
platforms.</p>
<p><strong>LIDAR-Based Navigation Performance</strong></p>
<p>The initial navigation architecture incorporated RPLidar A1 sensor
technology based on promising results documented in contemporary
robotics literature. Kumar and Singh’s research demonstrated 92%
localization success using LIDAR-based simultaneous localization and
mapping in laboratory environments, suggesting this technology
represented the optimal approach for indoor navigation. However,
systematic testing under realistic operating conditions with active
motor systems revealed fundamental limitations that rendered LIDAR-based
navigation impractical for the compact robot platform.</p>
<p>Testing protocols established baseline LIDAR performance with motors
disabled, then progressively increased motor power while measuring
localization accuracy. Table 1 documents the dramatic performance
degradation observed as electromagnetic interference from motor systems
corrupted time-of-flight distance measurements.</p>

catastrophically when motors operated at power levels typical of normal
navigation. At 100% forward power, position errors averaged 3.91 meters
in a test environment where room dimensions measured only five meters,
rendering position estimates essentially meaningless. The localization
success rate, defined as position estimates within 0.5 meters of ground
truth, fell from 94.2% with motors disabled to merely 10.2% under full
power operation. Most critically, mixed-direction motor activation
produced even worse performance than uniform forward motion, with
success rates below 9% when the robot attempted turning maneuvers
requiring opposing motor directions.</p>

<p>Root cause analysis using oscilloscope measurements revealed that
motor current spikes during acceleration generated electromagnetic
pulses with sufficient energy to trigger false returns in the LIDAR
receiver circuitry. The time-of-flight measurement principle underlying
LIDAR operation depends on precise timing of laser pulse transmission
and return detection. Electromagnetic interference created spurious
detector triggers that the sensor interpreted as reflected laser pulses,
generating distance measurements corresponding to nonexistent obstacles
or walls. The compact chassis design positioned the LIDAR unit within 20
centimeters of motor drivers, insufficient separation to attenuate
interference to acceptable levels without extensive electromagnetic
shielding that physical space constraints prevented implementing.</p>
<p><strong>The Impossibility of Machine Learning
Compensation</strong></p>
<p>A critical consideration that emerged during failure analysis
involved whether machine learning approaches could compensate for the
severe sensor degradation under electromagnetic interference conditions.
Contemporary robotics research increasingly employs deep learning models
to extract meaningful navigation information from noisy or ambiguous
sensor data, suggesting potential mitigation strategies for the observed
LIDAR and compass failures. However, systematic analysis revealed that
machine learning approaches could not salvage navigation capabilities
given the magnitude of sensor corruption documented in the testing
results.</p>
<p>The fundamental principle of supervised machine learning requires
training data exhibiting consistent relationships between inputs and
desired outputs. When LIDAR sensors report position errors exceeding
three meters in five-meter rooms, the sensor measurements contain
essentially no information regarding actual robot position beyond random
noise. Training neural networks to predict robot position from such
corrupted sensor readings would require the network to somehow extract
signal from pure noise, a task equivalent to predicting lottery numbers
from previous results. The 10% localization success rate indicates that
LIDAR measurements under motor operation correlate no better with actual
position than random guessing, providing no basis for learning
meaningful relationships.</p>
<p>Similarly, compass sensors reporting heading errors exceeding 90
degrees with variation ranges approaching 160 degrees depending on motor
activation state generate measurements that actively mislead rather than
inform navigation algorithms. Machine learning models trained on such
data would learn spurious correlations between motor commands and
heading estimates rather than actual robot orientation. The heading
measurements vary more as a function of which motors are energized than
as a function of actual robot rotation, meaning any learned model would
optimize for predicting motor state rather than orientation. This
represents a fundamental failure mode where sensors measure motor system
behavior rather than environmental quantities, rendering machine
learning compensation conceptually impossible regardless of model
sophistication or training data volume.</p>
<p>Beyond the fundamental impossibility of learning from meaningless
data, the computational constraints of embedded platforms like the
Raspberry Pi preclude execution of deep learning models capable of
attempting such compensation even if theoretically possible. Modern deep
neural networks for sensor fusion and navigation, such as those employed
in research-grade SLAM systems, typically require graphics processing
units with thousands of parallel compute cores to achieve real-time
inference rates. The Raspberry Pi 5, while representing substantial
advancement over previous generations, provides CPU-based computation
inadequate for executing inference on networks exceeding a few million
parameters at frame rates necessary for robot control.</p>
<p>Concrete performance measurements illustrate this computational
bottleneck. The YOLOv8 object detection model, representing a relatively
efficient modern computer vision architecture, achieves approximately
0.3 frames per second inference rate on Raspberry Pi 5 when processing
640x480 input images. This performance falls more than an order of
magnitude short of the five frames per second minimum required for
responsive robot control documented in the line-following
implementation. More sophisticated models incorporating temporal
information through recurrent architectures or attention mechanisms
would reduce inference rates further, potentially to one frame every
several seconds. Such latencies render real-time control impossible, as
the robot would traverse several meters between sensing updates at
typical navigation speeds.</p>
<p>The memory constraints of embedded platforms compound computational
limitations. Deep learning models capable of robust navigation typically
require several gigabytes of memory for model parameters and activation
storage during inference. The Raspberry Pi 5’s four gigabyte memory
capacity, when shared across operating system, robot control software,
camera drivers, and network communication, leaves insufficient memory
for loading large neural network models while maintaining other
essential system functions. Attempting to deploy models requiring memory
swapping to storage would reduce already inadequate inference rates by
additional orders of magnitude as the system thrashed between memory and
disk.</p>
<p>The practical implications indicate that machine learning approaches,
while theoretically appealing for handling sensor uncertainty, prove
completely infeasible for embedded robotics platforms operating under
realistic computational and memory constraints when sensor data quality
degrades to the levels observed in this research. The combination of
sensors providing effectively random measurements due to electromagnetic
interference and platforms lacking computational capacity for deep
learning inference eliminates machine learning as a viable compensation
strategy. This finding reinforces the conclusion that sensor selection
must prioritize electromagnetic compatibility and data quality rather
than assuming algorithmic sophistication can overcome fundamental
measurement failures.</p>
<p>The research team initially considered whether online learning
approaches, where models adapt continuously during operation rather than
requiring extensive offline training, might circumvent the corrupted
training data problem. However, online learning faces even more severe
challenges in this context. The robot would need to somehow determine
ground truth position and heading during operation to generate training
labels, requiring either external positioning infrastructure like motion
capture systems that residential environments lack, or reliance on the
very sensors whose failures necessitate the learning approach. This
circular dependency renders online learning approaches equally
infeasible for compensating sensor degradation.</p>
<p>These considerations validate the architectural decision to abandon
LIDAR and compass-based navigation entirely rather than attempting
machine learning compensation. The successful implementation using
classical computer vision approaches with simple color thresholding and
PID control, consuming minimal computational resources and providing
reliable performance, demonstrates that appropriate sensor selection
enabling straightforward classical algorithms outperforms sophisticated
machine learning applied to fundamentally corrupted sensor data on
computationally constrained platforms. This lesson proves particularly
relevant as robotics education increasingly emphasizes deep learning
approaches without adequate discussion of their computational
requirements and fundamental limitations when training data lacks
meaningful signal.</p>
<p><strong>Budget Constraints and Sensor Quality
Considerations</strong></p>
<p>An important consideration in evaluating the sensor failures involves
whether higher-quality sensor units might have demonstrated greater
electromagnetic interference immunity, potentially enabling the
originally planned multi-sensor fusion architecture. The RPLidar A1 unit
employed in testing represents an entry-level LIDAR sensor priced at
approximately $100, substantially less expensive than industrial-grade
LIDAR systems costing $1000 or more. Similarly, the HMC5883L
magnetometer modules cost merely $3-5 per unit, while precision inertial
measurement units incorporating magnetometers with advanced calibration
capabilities command prices exceeding $200. The research budget
constraints typical of undergraduate thesis projects necessitated
selection of lower-cost sensor options, raising questions about whether
performance limitations reflect fundamental physical constraints or
simply inadequate sensor quality.</p>
<p>However, several factors suggest that sensor quality represents a
minor contributor compared to fundamental electromagnetic compatibility
issues. First, the electromagnetic interference magnitudes measured
during testing exceeded sensor specifications by orders of magnitude
rather than marginal amounts. Motor current spikes generating
electromagnetic pulses with amplitudes measured in volts at sensor
locations overwhelm the millivolt-level signals that LIDAR
photodetectors and magnetometers process. Higher-quality sensors with
improved signal-to-noise ratios might tolerate interference levels ten
times greater than entry-level alternatives, but motor-generated
interference exceeded sensor signal levels by factors of one hundred to
one thousand. This magnitude of interference would require not
incrementally better sensors but rather fundamentally different sensing
modalities immune to electromagnetic fields.</p>
<p>Second, research literature documenting successful LIDAR-based
navigation typically employs sensors with specifications similar to
those tested in this research, suggesting that sensor quality alone does
not explain the observed failures. The RPLidar A1 specifications
indicate accuracy of ±1 centimeter and angular resolution of 1 degree,
comparable to many LIDAR units employed in academic robotics research.
The critical difference lies not in sensor precision but in operating
environment, specifically the electromagnetic quiet conditions
maintained in laboratory settings through careful sensor-motor
separation, extensive shielding, and sometimes operation with external
power supplies that eliminate motor battery sharing. Compact residential
service robots cannot implement such electromagnetic isolation measures
without sacrificing the small physical dimensions essential for
navigating doorways and corridors.</p>
<p>Third, consultation with sensor manufacturers regarding
electromagnetic interference mitigation revealed that even
industrial-grade LIDAR systems require minimum separation distances from
high-current motor systems, with recommended clearances typically
specified as 50-100 centimeters for motors operating at amperage levels
employed in this research. The compact robot chassis, measuring
approximately 40 centimeters in longest dimension, physically cannot
accommodate such separation distances while maintaining center of
gravity low enough for stability. This constraint reflects fundamental
physics of electromagnetic field propagation rather than sensor quality
issues amenable to solution through upgraded components.</p>
<p>The compass sensor failure analysis yields similar conclusions.
Magnetometers measure Earth’s magnetic field with magnitude
approximately 50 microtesla, while DC motors operating at 2-3 amperes
generate magnetic fields exceeding 1000 microtesla at 15-centimeter
distance. This thousand-fold interference-to-signal ratio would
overwhelm even precision aerospace-grade magnetometers costing thousands
of dollars. Advanced inertial measurement units employed in aircraft
navigation incorporate magnetometers but maintain strict separation from
electrical systems and implement extensive magnetic shielding,
approaches incompatible with compact ground robots where space and
weight constraints dominate design.</p>
<p>The practical implication for undergraduate robotics projects
indicates that budget constraints, while real, represent secondary
concerns compared to fundamental sensor-environment compatibility. The
research team’s available budget of approximately $800 for all robot
hardware components precluded acquisition of premium sensors costing
hundreds of dollars per unit. However, even if budget permitted such
expenditures, the electromagnetic environment and computational
constraints would likely produce similar failure outcomes. The critical
lesson involves recognizing that sensor specifications documented under
ideal laboratory conditions often fail to predict performance in the
harsh electromagnetic and computational environment characteristic of
compact motor-driven robots.</p>
<p>This analysis suggests that future robotics projects should allocate
budgets toward sensors demonstrating electromagnetic interference
immunity rather than pursuing maximum theoretical precision through
expensive units that prove equally vulnerable to motor-generated
interference. The successful camera-based line following implementation
employed a $25 camera module, substantially less expensive than the $100
LIDAR unit that failed, demonstrating that appropriate sensor selection
based on environmental compatibility outweighs sensor cost in
determining system success. Similarly, the $5 ultrasonic sensors proved
far more reliable for obstacle detection than the failed LIDAR despite
their lower theoretical precision and narrower field of view.</p>
<p>The research validates that undergraduate thesis projects can
successfully implement functional autonomous robots using components
available within typical academic budgets, provided sensor selection
prioritizes electromagnetic compatibility over theoretical
specifications. The temptation to acquire expensive sensors based on
impressive specification sheets should be tempered by realistic
assessment of operating environment characteristics, particularly
electromagnetic interference from motor systems and computational
constraints of embedded platforms. This pragmatic approach to component
selection, informed by systematic testing rather than specification
sheet comparisons, enabled eventual system success despite initial
sensor selection failures.</p>
<p>Attempted mitigation strategies including ferrite core installation
on motor power cables, grounded copper shielding around motor driver
modules, and software filtering of obviously erroneous distance readings
failed to improve localization accuracy beyond 15% success rate. The
fundamental physics of electromagnetic interference propagation at close
range, combined with the LIDAR sensor’s inherent sensitivity to
electrical noise, proved insurmountable within the constraints of
undergraduate thesis budgets and compact robotic platform dimensions.
This finding contradicts the implicit assumption in much of the robotics
literature that LIDAR technology provides universally superior
navigation capability, demonstrating instead that sensor selection must
account for the electromagnetic environment and that theoretical
performance often proves unattainable under realistic operating
conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Compass-Based Heading Estimation Performance</strong></p>
<p>Magnetometer-based compass sensors offered promise as a complementary
heading estimation technology that could augment visual odometry and
provide absolute orientation reference independent of accumulated drift
errors. Thompson and Kumar documented successful compass integration
achieving sub-degree heading accuracy when sensors maintained adequate
separation from motor systems. However, testing with HMC5883L
magnetometer modules revealed complete failure of compass-based heading
estimation in the compact robot platform.</p>
<p>Table 2 documents systematic measurement of heading estimate accuracy
as a function of sensor-motor separation distance and motor activation
state.</p>

<p>The data demonstrates that while compass sensors achieved acceptable
accuracy when motors remained disabled, any motor activation created
magnetic field distortions that completely overwhelmed the weak Earth
magnetic field that compass sensors measure. At the 15-centimeter
separation distance dictated by GPIO pin locations on the Raspberry Pi,
motors-on heading errors exceeded 90 degrees, with heading variation
ranges approaching 160 degrees depending on which specific motors were
energized. This performance renders compass-based navigation completely
unusable, as heading estimates effectively become random values bearing
no relationship to actual robot orientation.</p>
<p>The physical mechanism underlying this failure involves the strong
magnetic fields generated by DC motors operating at currents exceeding
two amperes per motor. Each motor acts as an electromagnet whose field
strength at close range exceeds the approximately 50 microtesla
magnitude of Earth’s magnetic field by several orders of magnitude. The
field direction and magnitude vary dramatically depending on motor
current direction and magnitude, creating heading estimate variations
that change instantaneously as motor control signals update. Attempted
mitigation through compass calibration procedures proved futile, as the
magnetic environment changes continuously during navigation rather than
maintaining the static distortions that calibration procedures
assume.</p>
<p>The implication for compact robotic platform design indicates
fundamental incompatibility between magnetometer-based navigation and
high-current motor systems when physical space constraints prevent
adequate sensor-motor separation. The 30-centimeter minimum separation
distance suggested by Table 2 for even marginally acceptable performance
proves impossible to achieve in robots designed to navigate residential
doorways and corridors where overall dimensions must remain compact.
This finding challenges assumptions in robotics education that compass
sensors provide cost-effective heading estimation, revealing instead
that these sensors prove useless in the electromagnetic environment
typical of DC motor-driven platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Camera-Based Line Following Performance</strong></p>
<p>Following the documented failures of LIDAR localization and
compass-based heading estimation, the research pivoted to computer
vision-based line following as the primary navigation approach. While
theoretically less sophisticated than sensor fusion approaches combining
multiple sensing modalities, line following offered critical advantages
including immunity to electromagnetic interference, minimal
computational requirements compatible with Raspberry Pi processing
capacity, and proven reliability in educational robotics contexts. The
decision to pursue camera-based navigation emerged only after exhaustive
evaluation of alternative visual approaches revealed fundamental
challenges inherent to image-based sensing in uncontrolled
environments.</p>
<p><strong>ArUco Marker Detection Failure</strong></p>
<p>The research initially investigated ArUco marker-based navigation as
a potentially superior alternative to simple line following. ArUco
markers, which are square fiducial markers composed of black and white
patterns encoding unique identifiers, enable precise robot localization
when detected within camera frames. Contemporary robotics literature
documents successful ArUco-based navigation achieving centimeter-level
position accuracy, suggesting this technology could provide
substantially more sophisticated navigation than binary line detection.
A Python Flask service implementing OpenCV’s ArUco detection algorithms
was developed and tested extensively as documented in the project’s
ArucoPy directory.</p>
<p>However, practical testing revealed that reliable ArUco detection
requires computational resources substantially exceeding Raspberry Pi
capabilities. The marker detection algorithm must process
full-resolution camera frames, identify potential marker candidates
through edge detection and contour analysis, decode the binary patterns
within candidate regions, and reject false detections through geometric
verification. This processing pipeline, when executed on the Raspberry
Pi’s ARM processor without GPU acceleration, achieved frame rates of
approximately 0.5-1.0 frames per second, completely inadequate for
real-time robot control requiring update rates of at least 5 frames per
second. The computational bottleneck reinforced the earlier conclusion
that the Raspberry Pi platform cannot support sophisticated computer
vision algorithms or machine learning models requiring substantial
processing throughput.</p>
<p>Beyond computational limitations, ArUco detection proved unreliable
under varying lighting conditions and camera angles typical of mobile
robot operation. Markers positioned on floors experienced perspective
distortion when viewed from robot-mounted cameras, complicating the
geometric verification steps that distinguish valid markers from false
positives. Lighting variations from windows, doorways, and overhead
fixtures created exposure challenges where markers alternated between
overexposed washout and underexposed darkness depending on robot
orientation. These environmental sensitivity issues would require
sophisticated adaptive exposure control and image preprocessing that
further exacerbate computational requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Color-Based Detection Failure</strong></p>
<p>Following ArUco’s computational inadequacy, the research explored
color-based landmark detection as an alternative navigation approach
offering simpler processing requirements. Color detection through RGB
thresholding requires minimal computation, potentially enabling
real-time operation even on constrained embedded platforms. Testing
employed OpenCV’s color space conversions and threshold filtering to
identify distinctively colored markers placed at navigation waypoints.
However, this approach encountered fundamental challenges that rendered
it impractical for reliable autonomous navigation.</p>
<p>The primary obstacle involved color constancy under varying
illumination conditions. Colors that appeared distinctly identifiable
under overhead fluorescent lighting shifted dramatically under natural
daylight from windows or different artificial light sources. The RGB
values of nominally identical colored markers varied by factors of two
or more depending on lighting conditions, requiring either prohibitively
wide threshold ranges that admitted false positive detections of
unrelated colored objects, or narrow thresholds that failed to detect
intended markers under lighting variations. Attempts to implement
adaptive thresholding based on ambient light measurements proved
inadequate, as lighting conditions varied spatially across the
navigation environment rather than uniformly.</p>
<p>The pixel-level sensitivity of color detection created additional
complications. Camera noise, compression artifacts, and sensor
imperfections meant that individual pixels within uniformly colored
regions exhibited substantial RGB variation. Reliable color detection
required considering spatial neighborhoods and statistical properties of
color distributions rather than simple per-pixel thresholding,
substantially increasing computational complexity. Moreover, the precise
color calibration required for reliable detection proved extremely
fragile, requiring recalibration whenever lighting conditions changed or
camera settings adjusted. This maintenance burden, combined with
unreliable performance, rendered color-based approaches impractical for
deployed systems.</p>
<p>The exploration of both ArUco markers and color-based detection
reinforced a critical lesson regarding computer vision in robotics
applications. Approaches that appear conceptually simple and prove
effective in controlled laboratory demonstrations often fail
catastrophically when deployed in uncontrolled environments with varying
lighting, viewing angles, and ambient conditions. The failure of these
theoretically superior navigation approaches validated the eventual
adoption of line following, despite its apparent simplicity, as the most
reliable computer vision technique given computational and environmental
constraints.</p>
<p><strong>Line Following Implementation Success</strong></p>
<p>Testing evaluated line following accuracy across varying
environmental conditions including different lighting levels, line
surface materials, and background floor textures. The implemented system
provides significant flexibility through configurable color thresholds
that enable following lines of arbitrary colors, adjustable to building
management preferences for different deployment environments. This
customization capability emerged naturally from the RGB thresholding
approach, where configuration parameters specify target color ranges
rather than hardcoding specific line colors. The flexibility to adapt to
different line colors without code modification represents a valuable
practical feature enabling deployment across diverse facilities with
varying aesthetic constraints or existing floor markings that could be
repurposed for robot navigation.</p>

<p>The results demonstrate that camera-based line following achieved
acceptable navigation reliability under normal indoor lighting
conditions, with success rates exceeding 87% when ambient illumination
ranged from 300 to 800 lux. Success rate was defined as completing the
full navigation path from starting position to destination without
leaving the line or requiring manual intervention. Performance degraded
somewhat in dim lighting conditions where insufficient contrast between
line and background complicated thresholding, and also decreased
slightly in very bright conditions where overexposure reduced color
differentiation.</p>
<p>The average deviation metric, measuring perpendicular distance
between robot centerline and floor line during navigation, remained
below 5 centimeters under optimal conditions, adequate for navigation
through corridors and doorways with clearances exceeding 50 centimeters.
Frame processing rates maintained approximately 5 frames per second
across all lighting conditions, providing sufficient update frequency
for responsive PID control that prevented large deviation
accumulation.</p>
<p>Critical to achieving these performance levels was the migration from
Python to .NET implementation of the robot control software. Comparative
testing documented in Table 4 reveals the substantial performance
difference between interpreted scripting languages and compiled
implementations.</p>

<p>The .NET implementation achieved more than double the frame
processing rate of Python while consuming substantially less CPU
capacity and memory. Most critically, motor control latency decreased
from 147 milliseconds in Python to just 34 milliseconds in .NET,
enabling far more responsive navigation that reacted quickly to line
position changes. This performance difference proved essential for
reliable line following, as the relatively slow two-frames-per-second
processing in Python allowed sufficient deviation accumulation between
updates that the robot frequently lost the line entirely.</p>

<p>The beacon-based localization achieved approximately 83% average
success rate across all rooms, meeting the design requirement for
reliable destination detection. Success rate was defined as correct room
identification when the robot reached the destination marker on the
floor line. False positive rates remained below 6% across all rooms,
indicating that the configured RSSI threshold of -60 dBm effectively
distinguished between proximity to the target beacon versus detection of
beacons in adjacent rooms.</p>
<p>Detection range measurements indicated that beacons became reliably
detectable at approximately 2-3 meters distance, adequate for triggering
destination arrival given typical room dimensions. However, substantial
RSSI variability due to human body obstruction and multipath reflection
prevented more precise position estimation. Standard deviation of RSSI
measurements at fixed positions typically exceeded 8 dBm, corresponding
to position uncertainty of approximately 1-2 meters using standard path
loss models. This variability confirmed that beacon-based approaches
suit room-level localization but cannot provide the centimeter-level
precision required by sophisticated path planning algorithms.</p>
<p>The combination of line-following navigation and beacon-based
destination detection proved effective for the laundry delivery
application, enabling reliable autonomous operation without the complex
sensor fusion approaches that failed during testing. This result
validates the principle that simpler technologies consistently
implemented often outperform sophisticated approaches that fail under
realistic operating conditions.</p>

<p>The weight measurement system achieved acceptable accuracy for
commercial laundry pricing applications, with absolute errors remaining
below 50 grams across the operational range. Relative errors below 1.5%
enabled reliable differentiation between pricing tiers typically
implemented in commercial laundry services. Measurement stability
testing, conducted by repeatedly measuring the same reference weight
without removing it from the platform, revealed typical variation of
±15-30 grams depending on load magnitude. This stability proved adequate
for pricing calculations but would require improvement for applications
demanding higher precision.</p>
<p>Maximum capacity testing with distributed loads simulating filled
laundry baskets confirmed stable operation up to 7 kilograms, meeting
the design requirement based on typical residential laundry volumes.
Loads exceeding 7 kilograms created concerning mechanical stress on the
chassis structure, establishing this value as the practical operational
limit. The weight capacity limitation reflects trade-offs between
payload capability and robot mobility, as increased structural strength
required to handle heavier loads would substantially increase overall
robot mass and reduce battery efficiency.</p>
<p><strong>Battery Performance and Operational Limitations</strong></p>
<p>The power system represents a significant operational constraint that
fundamentally limits deployment scalability and service throughput. The
robot employs rechargeable lithium-ion battery packs without
sophisticated battery management systems, reflecting both budget
limitations and the rushed development timeline that prevented
integration of proper power monitoring infrastructure. This decision,
while enabling rapid prototyping, created substantial operational
limitations that became apparent during extended testing campaigns.</p>
<p>Battery runtime testing under typical operational loads revealed
approximately 30 minutes of continuous active operation before voltage
levels dropped below safe motor operation thresholds. This runtime
measurement encompasses navigation with motors engaged, sensor systems
operating, and continuous network communication maintaining server
synchronization. The 30-minute operational window proves barely adequate
for completing single delivery cycles in the five-room test environment,
where navigation from base station to furthest room and return typically
consumed 15-20 minutes including customer interaction time for laundry
loading or retrieval.</p>
<p>The marginal battery capacity necessitated implementation of
mandatory charging after each delivery cycle regardless of remaining
charge level. This operational policy emerged from practical experience
where attempts to complete sequential deliveries without intermediate
charging resulted in mid-navigation battery depletion, stranding the
robot in corridors and requiring manual retrieval. The lack of
sophisticated battery monitoring systems prevented accurate remaining
capacity estimation, forcing conservative charging policies that
sacrificed throughput for reliability. The absence of automatic docking
systems, a planned feature that could not be implemented given
navigation challenges and hardware integration complexity, required
manual battery connection by human operators after each delivery.</p>
<p>Charging time measurements documented approximately one hour to
restore batteries from depleted state to operational capacity. While
substantially better than extended charging durations that would
completely prevent multi-delivery operations, the one-hour recharge
window still creates significant operational bottlenecks. The charging
duration reflects battery chemistry characteristics, available charging
current from standard wall adapters, and the lack of fast-charging
protocols that require sophisticated battery management systems to
prevent thermal damage during high-current charging. Combined with the
30-minute operational window, the one-hour charging requirement limits
theoretical maximum throughput to approximately two deliveries per
three-hour period, assuming immediate sequential operations without any
idle time between cycles.</p>
<p>Table 10 documents battery performance characteristics measured
across the eight-month development and testing period, revealing
progressive degradation patterns typical of lithium-ion cells operated
without battery management oversight.</p>

<p>The data reveals steady capacity degradation over the development
period, with runtime declining from initial 45 minutes to current 30
minutes, representing 33% capacity loss. The charging time increased
from 45 minutes initially to current one hour as internal cell
resistance grew due to repeated charge-discharge cycles without proper
voltage regulation and cell balancing. The voltage sag under load,
measuring the difference between open-circuit voltage and voltage during
motor operation, increased from 0.8 volts initially to 2.8 volts
currently, indicating substantial internal resistance growth that both
reduces available capacity and creates heating concerns during
operation.</p>
<p>The battery degradation patterns reflect several contributing factors
beyond normal aging. The absence of battery management systems meant
that cells experienced uncontrolled voltage excursions during discharge,
potentially dropping below safe minimum voltages that accelerate
degradation. Similarly, charging occurred without monitoring of
individual cell voltages within battery packs, allowing voltage
imbalances to develop where some cells reached full charge while others
remained partially charged. Over repeated cycles, these imbalances
compound, effectively reducing total pack capacity to that of the
weakest cell while potentially overcharging stronger cells beyond safe
limits.</p>
<p>The aggressive use patterns during development contributed additional
stress beyond typical consumer electronics applications. Extended
testing sessions involved continuous operation at high motor currents
during navigation algorithm development, subjecting batteries to
discharge rates exceeding manufacturer recommendations for sustained
periods. The lack of thermal management systems allowed battery
temperatures to rise substantially during operation, particularly when
ambient temperatures in the testing environment reached tropical levels
typical of Philippine climate. Elevated temperatures accelerate
lithium-ion degradation processes, explaining the rapid capacity loss
over the eight-month period.</p>
<p>Most critically, the battery packs employed lack fundamental safety
protections including overcharge prevention, overdischarge cutoff, short
circuit protection, and thermal runaway mitigation. These systems,
standard in commercial lithium-ion battery applications, require
dedicated battery management integrated circuits and protection
circuitry that budget and integration complexity constraints prevented
implementing. The research team maintained vigilant manual monitoring
during testing sessions to prevent catastrophic failures, implementing
charging cutoff and discharge limits through external procedures rather
than hardware protections. This approach proved adequate for controlled
laboratory testing but represents completely unacceptable safety posture
for any deployed system accessible to untrained users.</p>
<p>The practical implications create operational constraints while
remaining manageable for demonstration purposes. The 30-minute runtime
combined with one-hour charging requirement means that single-robot
systems can theoretically complete two deliveries per three-hour
operational period, representing marginal adequacy for limited-scale
service demonstration. However, the absence of automatic docking
eliminates the possibility of unattended operation, requiring human
operators to manually connect charging cables after each delivery cycle.
This manual intervention requirement substantially diminishes automation
benefits, as human operators must remain available throughout
operational periods for charging management.</p>
<p>The battery limitations highlight several lessons applicable to
future robotics projects. First, power system design deserves equal
priority with navigation and control systems during architecture
planning, as inadequate battery capacity and charging infrastructure can
completely undermine otherwise functional robotics platforms. Second,
battery management systems prove essential not merely for safety but for
achieving adequate operational lifetime, as unprotected lithium-ion
cells degrade rapidly under robotics use patterns. Third, automatic
charging infrastructure should be considered essential functionality
rather than optional enhancement, as manual charging requirements
severely compromise autonomous operation benefits.</p>
<p>Future implementations would require substantial power system
redesign including installation of proper battery management systems
with cell-level voltage monitoring and balancing, thermal management
systems preventing overheating during operation, automatic docking
stations enabling unattended charging between delivery cycles, and
potentially complete battery replacement given the severe degradation of
current packs. The estimated cost for implementing these improvements
exceeds $200 per robot, representing substantial fraction of total
hardware budget but proving absolutely necessary for any system
progressing beyond laboratory prototype toward deployment.</p>
<h3 id="system-usability-assessment">System Usability Assessment</h3>
<p>Following successful integration of functional navigation and weight
measurement capabilities, the complete system underwent usability
evaluation with representative users. This testing aimed to assess user
experience quality and identify interface elements requiring refinement
before potential deployment. Twelve participants representing potential
customers for laundry delivery services completed supervised testing
sessions where they interacted with the mobile application to submit
requests and track delivery status.</p>
<p><strong>Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire
Results</strong></p>
<p>The PSSUQ assessment instrument uses a seven-point scale where lower
scores indicate better usability, with one representing strong agreement
that the system possesses positive characteristics and seven indicating
strong disagreement. Table 7 presents aggregate results across the

<p>The overall PSSUQ mean score of 4.12 indicates moderate usability,
falling in the mid-range of the seven-point scale. This result suggests
that while the system functions adequately and users can accomplish
their intended tasks, substantial opportunities exist for usability
improvements. The relatively high standard deviation of 1.23 reveals
considerable variability in user perceptions, with some participants
rating the system quite positively while others identified significant
usability concerns.</p>
<p>Analysis of individual question responses revealed specific strengths
and weaknesses in the user experience. Questions addressing task
completion capability and basic functionality received relatively
favorable scores averaging around 3.5, indicating users successfully
submitted laundry requests and tracked delivery status without major
obstacles. However, questions regarding error recovery and help
documentation received less favorable scores averaging near 5.0,
suggesting users struggled when unexpected situations occurred and found
insufficient guidance for resolving problems. The moderate information
quality scores reflected participant feedback that status updates, while
present, lacked detail regarding estimated arrival times and specific
robot locations during navigation.</p>
<p><strong>System Usability Scale Results</strong></p>
<p>The SUS assessment provides a standardized metric enabling comparison
against established usability benchmarks across diverse system types.
SUS employs a five-point scale for ten questions, with responses
transformed into a normalized score ranging from zero to 100 where
higher scores indicate better usability. Industry benchmarks suggest
scores above 68 indicate acceptable usability, while scores exceeding 80
represent excellent user experience.</p>

<p>The system achieved an average SUS score of 63.54, falling slightly
below the 68-point threshold typically considered acceptable usability.
This result aligns with the PSSUQ findings indicating moderate but
improvable usability. The substantial score variation ranging from 50 to
85 reveals that user experience quality differed considerably depending
on individual participant backgrounds and expectations. Participants
with prior experience using mobile applications for service requests
tended to rate the system more favorably, while those less familiar with
smartphone-based service interactions encountered more difficulty.</p>
<p>Qualitative feedback collected during testing sessions identified
specific usability concerns that the quantitative scores reflect.
Multiple participants expressed confusion regarding the request status
workflow, particularly the distinction between “robot en route” and
“arrived at room” states that seemed redundant from a customer
perspective. Several participants requested push notifications for
status changes rather than requiring manual application checking to
discover delivery progress. The payment confirmation interface received
mixed feedback, with some users appreciating the weight-based pricing
transparency while others found the multi-step confirmation process
unnecessarily complex.</p>
<p>Positive feedback emphasized the simplicity of initial request
submission, which required only room selection and estimated weight
input. Participants appreciated the visual status indicator showing
delivery progress through a graphical workflow representation. The
ability to view request history and past delivery records received
favorable mentions, though several participants noted they would prefer
more detailed historical information including exact delivery timestamps
and final weights.</p>
<p>The usability assessment results indicate that while the system
achieves functional requirements and enables users to complete intended
tasks, refinement of interface design and addition of proactive
notifications would substantially improve user experience. The
slightly-below-acceptable SUS score suggests the system approaches
deployment readiness but would benefit from iterative interface
improvements informed by user feedback before large-scale rollout.</p>
<h3 id="comparative-performance-analysis">Comparative Performance

<p>The automated robot delivery system achieved average delivery times
of 8.7 minutes compared to 24.3 minutes for manual delivery,
representing 64.2% time improvement. Perhaps more significantly, the
robot maintained far greater consistency with standard deviation of 2.4
minutes versus 10.7 minutes for manual delivery. This consistency
reflects the robot’s immunity to human factors including fatigue,
distraction, and variable walking speeds that affect manual delivery
performance.</p>
<p>During peak hours when multiple simultaneous delivery requests
occurred, the performance advantage of automated delivery increased to
73% time improvement. Manual delivery during peak periods suffered from
handler overload and queuing delays, while the robot maintained
relatively consistent performance independent of request volume. This
finding validates the operational efficiency benefits of automation for
service delivery applications experiencing variable demand patterns.</p>
<h3 id="discussion-of-architectural-evolution">Discussion of
Architectural Evolution</h3>
<p>The substantial differences between the initially proposed system
architecture and the final implemented design reflect critical lessons
about the gap between theoretical robotics research and deployable
systems operating under realistic constraints. The evolution from
ambitious multi-sensor fusion incorporating LIDAR mapping and
compass-based navigation to pragmatic line-following combined with
beacon localization illustrates the importance of empirical validation
during system design rather than assuming technologies will perform as
specifications suggest.</p>
<p>The LIDAR localization failure, characterized by accuracy degradation
from 94% with motors disabled to merely 10% under normal operating
conditions, reveals fundamental incompatibility between time-of-flight
distance measurement principles and the electromagnetic environment
surrounding high-current motor systems. This finding challenges the
widespread assumption in robotics literature that LIDAR represents
universally superior navigation technology, demonstrating instead that
sensor selection must carefully consider the operating environment. The
compact physical dimensions required for residential robot navigation
preclude electromagnetic shielding approaches that might mitigate
interference in larger platforms where sensors can be positioned far
from motor systems.</p>
<p>The compass-based heading estimation failure proved equally
definitive, with heading errors exceeding 90 degrees rendering
magnetometer data completely unusable for navigation purposes. The
strong magnetic fields generated by DC motors operating at multi-ampere
currents completely overwhelm the weak Earth magnetic field that compass
sensors measure, creating heading estimates that vary randomly depending
on motor activation state. This finding has important implications for
robotics education, where compass sensors are often presented as
cost-effective heading estimation solutions without adequate discussion
of their limitations in electromagnetically noisy environments typical
of motor-driven platforms.</p>
<p>The successful pivot to camera-based line following combined with
Bluetooth beacon localization demonstrates that simpler technologies
consistently implemented often outperform sophisticated approaches that
fail under realistic operating conditions. The 87% navigation success
rate achieved through single-camera line following, while theoretically
less impressive than the 92% rates reported for LIDAR-based systems in
controlled environments, represents actual demonstrated performance
under real-world conditions including electromagnetic interference and
computational constraints. The immunity of optical sensors to
electromagnetic interference, combined with minimal computational
requirements compatible with embedded platform capabilities, enabled
reliable autonomous operation that more sophisticated sensor fusion
approaches could not achieve.</p>
<p>The transition from Node.js backend to ASP.NET Core 8 architecture
reflects performance requirements that became apparent only through
systematic benchmarking rather than theoretical analysis. The
substantial improvement in response times and reduction in server
resource consumption validated the architectural change despite
requiring extensive code rewriting. Similarly, the robot control
software migration from Python to .NET 8 proved essential for achieving
frame processing rates adequate for responsive line following. These
architectural decisions highlight the importance of performance
profiling and willingness to abandon initial technology selections when
empirical measurements reveal inadequate performance.</p>
<p>The GPIO pin allocation conflicts that prevented implementation of
secure compartment closure mechanisms illustrate hardware integration
challenges rarely discussed in robotics literature focusing on
algorithmic sophistication rather than practical system implementation.
The Raspberry Pi’s limited GPIO availability, when distributed across
motor control, sensor inputs, status indicators, and weight measurement
systems, left insufficient pins for additional actuators without
sacrificing essential navigation capabilities. This constraint reflects
fundamental trade-offs in embedded platform selection, where increasing
computational capability often comes at the cost of reduced peripheral
interfaces compared to microcontroller platforms offering dozens of GPIO
pins but insufficient processing power for computer vision
applications.</p>
<p>The inability to replicate the hardware platform within budget
constraints, resulting in single-robot operation rather than the
multi-robot fleet coordination envisioned in initial designs,
demonstrates how resource limitations fundamentally constrain achievable
system complexity. The software architecture supporting multiple robot
connections remains implemented in the backend server, enabling future
fleet expansion when additional hardware becomes available. However, the
single-robot limitation during development and testing prevented
validation of multi-robot coordination algorithms and queue optimization
strategies that motivated the distributed system architecture.</p>
<p>These architectural evolution patterns reveal several principles
applicable to future autonomous robotics projects operating under
similar constraints. First, sensor selection must prioritize
electromagnetic interference immunity and computational efficiency
rather than theoretical precision, particularly for compact platforms
where sensor-motor separation distances remain minimal. Second,
programming language selection significantly impacts achievable
performance in embedded robotics applications, with compiled
implementations enabling real-time processing that interpreted scripting
languages cannot sustain. Third, hardware integration complexity grows
rapidly as sensor and actuator counts increase, quickly exceeding
available GPIO pins and forcing careful prioritization of essential
functionality. Fourth, budget constraints impose hard limits on system
complexity, requiring pragmatic acceptance that demonstrated
functionality with simplified architectures surpasses non-functional
sophisticated designs.</p>
<p>The research also highlights the value of iterative development
methodologies that embrace failure as an information source rather than
viewing failed approaches as wasted effort. The systematic documentation
of LIDAR and compass sensor failures, including quantitative performance
measurements and root cause analyses, provides guidance for future
projects that might otherwise repeat the same unsuccessful approaches.
The willingness to pivot from multi-sensor fusion to single-camera
navigation when empirical testing revealed fundamental incompatibilities
enabled eventual success, whereas rigid adherence to initial designs
would have resulted in non-functional systems.</p>
<h3 id="research-question-analysis">Research Question Analysis</h3>
<p><strong>Research Question 1: How can sensor fusion and basic computer
vision be effectively implemented for obstacle recognition and
navigation in indoor environments despite hardware limitations and
market availability constraints?</strong></p>
<p>The research findings indicate that effective indoor navigation under
realistic constraints requires abandoning complex sensor fusion
approaches in favor of simpler technologies that prove compatible with
electromagnetic environments and computational limitations. The
attempted implementation of LIDAR and compass sensor fusion failed
completely, achieving only 10% localization accuracy due to
electromagnetic interference from motor systems. In contrast,
single-camera line following combined with ultrasonic obstacle detection
achieved 87% navigation success rate under normal operating
conditions.</p>
<p>The key insight emerging from this investigation reveals that sensor
fusion’s theoretical advantages disappear when constituent sensors
produce unreliable data due to environmental factors. The
electromagnetic fields generated by high-current motor systems corrupt
both LIDAR time-of-flight measurements and compass magnetometer readings
to such extent that no amount of algorithmic sophistication can extract
useful navigation information. The research demonstrates that computer
vision-based approaches, while requiring careful attention to lighting
conditions and color contrast, prove far more robust to electromagnetic
interference than time-of-flight or magnetic field measurement
techniques.</p>
<p>The implementation successfully integrated basic computer vision
through color-based thresholding and contour detection algorithms that
identify floor line positions within camera frames. The PID control
system translating line position measurements into differential motor
speed commands enabled smooth path following without requiring
sophisticated path planning or mapping capabilities. The ultrasonic
sensor-based obstacle detection complemented visual navigation by
triggering emergency stops when obstacles appeared within stopping
distance, providing adequate collision avoidance without complex
computer vision-based object recognition.</p>
<p>The Bluetooth beacon-based room localization, achieving 83% success
rate for destination detection, demonstrates that simple RSSI
thresholding provides adequate positioning for service delivery
applications despite substantial signal variability. This approach
requires minimal computational resources and proves immune to
electromagnetic interference, unlike more sophisticated positioning
technologies requiring precision timing measurements susceptible to
electrical noise.</p>
<p>The research validates that effective autonomous navigation can be
achieved through judicious selection of complementary simple
technologies rather than pursuing complex sensor fusion incorporating
sensors incompatible with the operating environment. The key lies in
matching sensor technologies to environmental conditions and
computational constraints rather than selecting sensors based on
theoretical capabilities demonstrated in controlled laboratory
settings.</p>
<p><strong>Research Question 2: What combination of accessible sensors,
motors, and control systems will provide optimal performance for
reliable robot navigation and successful delivery completion within
practical constraints and component availability?</strong></p>
<p>The systematic testing of various hardware combinations revealed that
optimal performance emerges from component selection prioritizing
reliability and electromagnetic compatibility rather than theoretical
sophistication. The final hardware configuration that achieved
functional autonomous operation consists of four DC motors with L298N
H-bridge drivers, single CSI camera module, dual HC-SR04 ultrasonic
sensors, HX711 load cell amplifier with strain gauge platform, and
Bluetooth Low Energy beacon receivers integrated through the Raspberry
Pi 5 platform.</p>
<p>Motor system selection involved trade-offs between power capacity,
physical dimensions, and GPIO pin requirements. The initially specified
BTS7960 drivers offered superior current handling capability exceeding
four amperes per channel, potentially enabling more aggressive
acceleration and higher payload capacities. However, the physical
dimensions of BTS7960 modules proved incompatible with the compact
chassis design required for residential navigation. The L298N drivers,
while limited to two amperes per channel, provided adequate power for
the four-motor configuration while occupying minimal board space and
requiring only two GPIO pins per motor channel. This selection
exemplifies the principle that adequate performance achievable within
constraints surpasses superior performance that cannot be physically
implemented.</p>
<p>The single-camera approach for visual navigation emerged as optimal
after dual-camera stereoscopic vision proved excessively complex for
integration within available development time. The computational
overhead of processing two simultaneous camera streams, performing
stereo calibration, and computing disparity maps exceeded Raspberry Pi
capabilities when combined with motor control responsibilities. The
single camera provides sufficient information for line following while
consuming manageable computational resources, validating that adequate
sensor capability enabling functional implementation outweighs superior
capability requiring unachievable computational performance.</p>
<p>Ultrasonic sensors proved optimal for obstacle detection compared to
LIDAR alternatives due to their electromagnetic interference immunity
and minimal computational requirements. While offering lower precision
and narrower field of view than LIDAR arrays, ultrasonic sensors
reliably detect obstacles within stopping distance without complex
signal processing or interference mitigation. The dual-sensor
configuration provides adequate coverage of the robot’s forward path
without requiring extensive sensor arrays that would consume excessive
GPIO pins and processing capacity.</p>
<p>The weight measurement system utilizing HX711 load cell amplifier
represents a successful component selection providing necessary
functionality with straightforward integration. The measurement accuracy
of approximately 50 grams across the operational range proves adequate
for weight-based pricing while requiring only two GPIO pins and minimal
processing overhead. More sophisticated weight sensing approaches
offering higher precision would provide marginal benefit for the laundry
delivery application while consuming additional resources better
allocated to navigation capabilities.</p>
<p>The Raspberry Pi 5 platform selection balanced computational
capability against cost and availability constraints. The platform
provides sufficient processing power for real-time camera frame
processing at five frames per second while simultaneously managing motor
control, sensor acquisition, and network communication. Lower-cost
alternatives like Raspberry Pi 4 proved marginally capable but with
insufficient performance headroom for reliable operation when system
load peaked during simultaneous camera processing and motor
acceleration. Higher-capability platforms like dedicated robotics
computers would provide computational overhead but at costs exceeding
undergraduate thesis budgets.</p>
<p>The optimal component combination discovered through this research
prioritizes electromagnetic compatibility, computational efficiency,
physical dimensions, GPIO pin availability, and demonstrated reliability
over theoretical performance specifications. The systematic evaluation
process that identified this combination required testing multiple
sensor configurations and documenting failure modes, validating the
importance of empirical validation over reliance on manufacturer
specifications when designing embedded robotic systems.</p>
<p><strong>Research Question 3: To what extent will the implementation
of an automated laundry delivery system improve service efficiency and
create opportunities for technical workforce development compared to
traditional manual delivery methods, as measured through standardized
assessment tools?</strong></p>
<p>The quantitative measurements comparing automated robot delivery
against traditional manual approaches demonstrate substantial efficiency
improvements across multiple dimensions. The average delivery time of
8.7 minutes for automated delivery represents 64.2% improvement over the
24.3-minute average for manual delivery. Perhaps more significantly, the
robot delivery maintained far greater consistency with standard
deviation of 2.4 minutes compared to 10.7 minutes for manual approaches,
reflecting immunity to human factors affecting manual delivery
performance.</p>
<p>The efficiency advantages became even more pronounced during peak
demand periods when multiple simultaneous delivery requests occurred.
The automated system achieved 73% time improvement during peak hours
compared to manual delivery, as human operators experienced overload and
queuing delays while the robot maintained relatively consistent
performance. This finding validates operational efficiency benefits
particularly relevant for service applications experiencing variable
demand patterns throughout daily cycles.</p>
<p>The usability assessment through standardized instruments revealed
moderate user acceptance with opportunities for improvement. The System
Usability Scale score of 63.54, while falling slightly below the
68-point threshold typically considered acceptable, demonstrates that
users can successfully accomplish intended tasks using the mobile
application interface. The Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire
results with mean score of 4.12 align with this assessment, indicating
moderate usability requiring refinement before optimal user experience
quality.</p>
<p>The comparative analysis reveals that while the automated system
improves operational efficiency substantially, user interface design
significantly impacts perceived service quality independent of
underlying automation capabilities. The quantitative usability scores
suggest that interface refinements including proactive status
notifications, simplified payment workflows, and enhanced error recovery
guidance would improve user satisfaction without requiring changes to
core robot navigation capabilities.</p>
<p>Regarding workforce development implications, the research
demonstrates patterns consistent with broader service automation
literature. The implementation creates technical positions in system
maintenance, robot monitoring, and software oversight while reducing
demand for manual delivery labor. The single-robot deployment prevented
quantitative workforce impact assessment, but the software architecture
supporting multi-robot fleet coordination suggests that scaled
deployment would require staff capable of monitoring multiple
simultaneous robot operations, diagnosing navigation failures, and
performing preventive maintenance on hardware systems.</p>
<p>The technical skill requirements for system operation substantially
exceed those for manual delivery, requiring understanding of network
connectivity troubleshooting, robot status interpretation, and
intervention procedures when automated operations encounter unexpected
conditions. The administrative dashboard implementation provides tools
enabling technically trained staff to monitor fleet operations, adjust
system parameters, and manually override automated decisions when
circumstances require human judgment. These capabilities suggest
workforce transformation toward higher-skill positions rather than
simple labor reduction, though scaled deployment across multiple
facilities would be necessary to quantify employment effects
definitively.</p>
<p>The research demonstrates that automated laundry delivery systems
provide measurable operational efficiency improvements while requiring
careful attention to user interface design and technical workforce
development to achieve successful deployment. The moderate usability
scores indicate that automation technology alone proves insufficient
without complementary investment in interface refinement and user
experience optimization.</p>
<h3 id="lessons-learned-and-future-directions">Lessons Learned and
Future Directions</h3>
<p>The development of this autonomous laundry delivery system generated
numerous insights applicable to future robotics projects attempting
similar autonomous service applications under realistic resource
constraints. The most fundamental lesson concerns the substantial gap
between theoretical robotics capabilities and achievable performance
when systems operate in electromagnetically noisy environments with
limited computational resources and compact physical dimensions.</p>
<p>The systematic documentation of sensor failures provides valuable
guidance for future projects. LIDAR-based navigation, while
theoretically offering millimeter-level precision, proves completely
unusable in compact platforms where electromagnetic interference from
motor systems corrupts time-of-flight measurements. Future projects
should carefully evaluate electromagnetic compatibility before selecting
navigation sensors, prioritizing technologies immune to electrical noise
over those offering superior theoretical precision in ideal conditions.
Similarly, compass-based heading estimation fails catastrophically in
proximity to high-current motor systems, rendering magnetometer sensors
inappropriate for compact robotic platforms regardless of algorithmic
sophistication.</p>
<p>The successful implementation of simplified navigation approaches
demonstrates that adequate functionality achieved through reliable
simple technologies surpasses theoretical superiority of complex
approaches that fail under realistic conditions. Camera-based line
following combined with beacon-based localization, while lacking the
sophistication of SLAM algorithms and multi-sensor fusion, proved
capable of reliable autonomous operation within the target environment.
Future projects should resist the temptation to implement maximally
sophisticated technologies, instead prioritizing demonstrated
reliability and electromagnetic compatibility when selecting system
architectures.</p>
<p>The programming language selection significantly impacting achievable
real-time performance highlights the importance of compiled
implementations for embedded robotics applications. The substantial
frame processing rate improvements achieved through migration from
Python to .NET validate that language overhead matters critically in
resource-constrained contexts, contrary to conventional wisdom that
algorithmic efficiency dominates performance considerations. Future
projects should evaluate language performance empirically rather than
assuming scripting languages provide adequate performance for real-time
control applications.</p>
<p>Hardware integration complexity growing rapidly with sensor and
actuator counts demonstrates that GPIO pin availability often becomes
the limiting constraint in embedded robotics platforms. The inability to
implement secure compartment closure due to pin allocation conflicts
illustrates that component count reduction sometimes proves necessary to
maintain essential functionality within platform constraints. Future
projects should carefully budget GPIO pin requirements during initial
design rather than discovering conflicts late in development when
significant hardware redesign becomes necessary.</p>
<p>The budget constraints preventing multi-robot implementation
highlight the importance of modular system architectures that enable
graceful degradation when full hardware complement remains unavailable.
The software infrastructure supporting multiple robot connections
despite physical deployment of only single unit demonstrates that
careful architectural design can preserve future expansion capabilities
even when current resource limitations prevent complete
implementation.</p>
<p>Several specific improvements would substantially enhance system
capabilities in future iterations. The addition of advanced path
planning algorithms enabling navigation without floor-mounted line
guides would dramatically expand operational flexibility, allowing
service to rooms lacking pre-installed navigation infrastructure.
However, such capabilities require either substantially more powerful
onboard computing to support deep learning-based visual navigation, or
installation of environmental mapping infrastructure like
ceiling-mounted fiducial markers providing absolute position references
immune to electromagnetic interference.</p>
<p>The integration of predictive maintenance capabilities monitoring
motor current consumption, battery degradation patterns, and navigation
performance metrics over time could enable proactive servicing before
critical component failures occur. The extensive telemetry already
captured by the system provides foundation for machine learning models
identifying anomalous performance patterns indicating impending
failures.</p>
<p>The mobile payment gateway integration would improve user experience
by enabling direct in-app payment rather than requiring manual
verification through administrative staff. However, such integration
requires compliance with payment card industry security standards and
partnership with payment processing services, representing substantial
additional development effort beyond the scope of undergraduate thesis
projects.</p>
<p>The implementation of customer notification systems providing
proactive push notifications when robots depart for pickup, arrive at
destinations, or encounter unexpected delays would substantially improve
perceived service quality. The moderate usability scores partially
reflect user frustration with requirement for manual status checking
rather than proactive notifications of delivery progress.</p>
<p>The research demonstrates that functional autonomous service robots
can be developed within undergraduate thesis constraints by prioritizing
demonstrated reliability over theoretical sophistication, accepting
simplified sensor configurations when necessary, and maintaining focus
on complete system integration rather than optimizing individual
components in isolation. These lessons, grounded in measured performance
data and honest assessment of both successes and failures, provide
valuable guidance for future robotics projects attempting similar
autonomous service applications under realistic resource
limitations.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>This research successfully developed and deployed an autonomous
laundry delivery robot system demonstrating that functional service
automation can be achieved within undergraduate thesis constraints
through pragmatic engineering decisions prioritizing demonstrated
reliability over theoretical sophistication. The final implemented
system, while substantially simpler than initially proposed multi-sensor
fusion architectures, achieved 87% navigation success rate and 83% room
detection accuracy using camera-based line following combined with
Bluetooth beacon localization. The system demonstrated 64% improvement
in delivery time compared to manual approaches while maintaining far
greater consistency immune to human factors affecting traditional
service delivery.</p>
<p>The research makes significant contributions through comprehensive
documentation of both successful implementations and critical sensor
failures that guided architectural evolution. The quantitative
performance measurements revealing LIDAR localization accuracy degrading
from 94% to merely 10% under electromagnetic interference conditions,
and compass heading errors exceeding 90 degrees in proximity to motor
systems, provide valuable cautionary guidance for future robotics
projects. These findings challenge widespread assumptions in robotics
literature that sophisticated sensors universally outperform simpler
alternatives, demonstrating instead that sensor selection must carefully
consider electromagnetic compatibility and computational constraints
rather than relying on theoretical specifications.</p>
<p>The successful pivot from complex sensor fusion to simplified but
functional approaches validates the principle that adequate performance
reliably achieved surpasses superior performance theoretically possible
but practically unattainable under realistic constraints. The systematic
testing methodology that empirically evaluated multiple navigation
approaches rather than assuming theoretical capabilities would translate
to deployed systems represents a valuable model for future research
emphasizing demonstrated functionality over algorithmic
sophistication.</p>
<p>The moderate usability assessment results, with System Usability
Scale score of 63.54 falling slightly below acceptable thresholds,
indicate that while the core automation capabilities function
adequately, user interface refinements would substantially improve
service quality. This finding highlights that successful autonomous
service deployment requires balanced attention to both underlying
automation technology and human-computer interaction design rather than
focusing exclusively on robotic capabilities.</p>
<p>The research demonstrates that autonomous service robotics represents
a viable application domain for undergraduate thesis projects when scope
remains focused on demonstrable functionality within constrained
environments rather than attempting general-purpose capabilities
requiring industrial-scale resources. The honest documentation of the
substantial gap between initially proposed capabilities and final
implemented functionality provides realistic expectations for future
projects, acknowledging that resource limitations fundamentally
constrain achievable complexity regardless of theoretical
possibilities.</p>
<p>Future research directions include investigation of visual navigation
approaches enabling operation without floor-mounted line infrastructure,
integration of predictive maintenance capabilities leveraging collected
telemetry data, implementation of multi-robot fleet coordination
strategies when budget permits hardware replication, and refinement of
user interfaces based on usability assessment findings. The software
architecture supporting these enhancements remains implemented in the
backend infrastructure, enabling incremental capability additions as
resources become available without requiring fundamental system
redesigns.</p>
<p>This research ultimately demonstrates that the critical challenge in
autonomous service robotics lies not in algorithmic sophistication but
rather in careful matching of technologies to operational constraints,
willingness to pivot from non-viable approaches based on empirical
evidence, and balanced attention to complete system integration
encompassing hardware, software, and human interfaces. The lessons
documented through this research, particularly regarding sensor
selection under electromagnetic interference conditions and programming
language performance impacts in embedded contexts, provide valuable
guidance for the growing community of researchers and students
attempting to translate theoretical robotics concepts into deployed
autonomous service systems.</p>
